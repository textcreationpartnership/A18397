            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ASTER <hi>Francis Maſon</hi> hauing (as he ſaith) receiued from you <hi>direction and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in making his booke <hi>of the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bishops in the Church of England,</hi> doth therefore preſent you with it, as due vnto you: And it ſeemeth to haue bin to your content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſufficiently performing that, which he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth therein. For (as I haue heard) you conuented diuers Catholique Prieſts (whom you wrongfully kept in priſon) to teſtifie, that they had ſeene ſuch regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as he citeth for the iuſtifying of your ordination; eſteeming (as may appeare) that nothing elſe wanted for the full clearing of that matter. VVhich ſole action vvas the firſt occaſion, that made me thinke of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe thereof. For perceiuing thereby, that you and your aſſiſtents, made reckoning of the booke, as of a full iuſtification of your calling, I thought it labour nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther idly, nor ill beſtovved to make you ſee, (ſithence you either did not, or vvould not ſee it before) how farre short it commeth of that marke. I addreſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Treatiſe vnto you, to the end that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it vvith <hi>M. Maſons</hi> Apologetical Dialogue, you may
<pb facs="tcp:23816:3"/> iudge vvhether he hath indeed performed that, vvhich he ſo confidently affirmeth in the firſt face of his booke: to vvit, <hi>to haue iuſtified the conſecration of the Bishops of the Church in England, to containe nothing contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Councels, and Fathers, or approoued example of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue antiquitie.</hi> You may peraduenture maruell, that I should put the trial of this matter to you, knovving you ſo farre intereſted therein as you are. But the reaſon is, becauſe I hold the negatiue ſo euident, that I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvaded you cannot, vvithout forfaiture of your iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, determine the contrary.</p>
            <p>If you had not hindred the publication of the booke vvritten not many yeares agoe, of this ſubiect, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the vvritten copy, vvhich, (knovving belike that it cannot be anſvvered) you ſtill retaine, I might and vvould haue ſpared this labour, or haue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies beſtovved it. But ſeeing you are not content, only to hinder the diſcouery of your no vocation, but doe ſet others on vvorke to maintaine and bolſter it vp, to the preiudice of the truth, you cannot iuſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, if by this occaſion, that be laid open to the view of the vvorld, vvhich you deſire should remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene, and vnknowne.</p>
            <p>If you finde your ſelfe proued here to be no Bishop, but a meere Vſurper of that title, I vvil deſire (though I cannot greatly hope) that you should either depoſe it, or at leaſt make your ſelfe capable thereof. But if you thinke there is no ſuch thing here performed, I vvill expect that you should encourage either <hi>M. Maſon,</hi> or ſome other, to ſatisfie the arguments heere propoſed to proue the ſame. If not, your ſilence shal be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an acknovvledgement of that vvhere vvith you are here charged, that is, of your no lavvfull miniſtery and

               </gap>ous Reader) in his Booke <hi>of the conſecration of the Bishops in the Church of England,</hi> had either directly proued their lawfull calling, or impugned that of the Bishops of the Catholike Roman church, he might haue expected from his Catholike aduerſaries ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the ſame. But ſeeing he pretendeth onely to cleare them, from the iuſt imputations laid vpon them by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Authors (which he calleth ſlanders) and thereby maketh himſelfe only Defendant, he cannot with any reaſon, expect from them any reply, in forme of anſwer, to his booke. For there are few but know this difference betweene the defendant, and the Plaintiffe or Appellant: that the Defendant muſt neceſſarily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all and euery obiection brought againſt him whereas the Appellant is not bound to reply, to his anſwers made to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obiection, but may (if he thinke good to impugne either his anſweres, or the cauſe he maintaineth) make his choice of one, two, three, or moe, as he shall thinke moſt for his aduantage. Which if he can in ſuch ſort enforce againſt his aduerſary, as he is not able to ſatiſfie them, he shall clearly gaine his cauſe againſt him. For example, he that being accuſed of felonie, or treaſon, and therefore defedant, is neceſſarily constrayned to anſwer to all, and euery important accuſation laid againſt him, and if he faile in the anſwer but of one only, he wil be found guilty; whereas his aduerſary being appellant, is not tied for the euicting of his cauſe, to reply vpon his anſwer to euery accuſation, but may make
<pb facs="tcp:23816:4"/> free choice of ſuch, and ſo many, either of his former accuſations, or any other, as he findeth fitteſt for his purpoſe, which if he can preſſe in ſuch ſort, as the defendant cannot auoid them, he shal conuict him to be guilty. <hi>M. Maſon</hi> therefore making himſelfe meerely Defendant in this quarrel, is not to expect that I, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as Appellant, to proue their Bishops to haue no lawfull calling, should reply vpon euery parcell of his whole booke, in forme of anſwer to that which he ſaith. For beſides that this would coſt both me, and the Reader more labour, then the thing is worth, it is no way neceſſary for my purpoſe: which is not to anſwer him (who making himſelfe Defendant hath the place of the anſwerer) but to impugne the thing that he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; which whether I haue performed effectually or no, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the anſweres which he hath already made in this his booke, I leaue to the cenſure of the iudicious though otherwiſe partiall Reader.</p>
            <p>Furthermore <hi>M. Maſon</hi> thorow his whole Booke making choice only of ſuch arguments, as he thinketh good to propoſe againſt himſelfe, and vrging them only ſo farre, as he thinketh he can make ſome shew of ſoluing them (like vnto little children that build Castles of Tile-shards, and afterwards pleaſe themſelues in throwing them downe) cannot hope that his aduerſary should fauour him ſo farre, as (leauing his best aduantage either in the choice of his arguments, or in the maner of vrging them) to bestow his time and trauell in refuting the anſweres, which he frameth to his owne obiections. This fauourable courſe (to deale plainly) I intend not to hold with <hi>M. Maſon.</hi> Yet will I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him, that where I finde he ſaith any thing, either for the preuenting, or anſwering any argument here by me propoſed, it shal not be diſſembled, but ſet downe in his owne words, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture vrged farther, then it is by him, which is as much, as he can with any reaſon expect at my hands in this cauſe. But, (to note this by the way) why is <hi>M. Maſon</hi> ſo could in this matter
<pb facs="tcp:23816:5"/> of their calling, that he propoſeth not to himſelfe to proue it, neither by Scripture, Traditions, Councels, nor Fathers, (all which kinde of proofes he knoweth to be authenticall with vs) but only pretendeth <hi>to cleare it from the ſlanders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In the face of his booke.</note> 
               <hi>and odious imputations of the Romaniſts, and to iuſtifie it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nothing contrary to the Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, or approued examples of primitiue antiquity.</hi> It is knowne they exact of Catholikes with all rigour and inſtance, poſitiue and preciſe proofe of Scripture for their doctrine in all points of controuerſie. Why doth not therefore <hi>M. Maſon</hi> bring at leaſt ſuch proofes, of Traditions, Councels, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (which he knoweth are not reiected by vs) for their new miniſtery, but contenteth himſelfe with the buckler, and ſtandeth only vpon his defence? Marry for this reaſon: that neither Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, or Traditions yeeld him any one poſitiue proofe of their vocation; or if they doe, I chalenge him to produce it, and he shall gaine his cauſe. Neither will I bind him to finde his proofes out of the Fathers within the firſt fiue hundreth yeares after Christ,<note place="margin">D.

            <p>Againe, (to come yet more neere him) what doth he thinke is ſufficient, to cleare and iuſtifie their calling, <hi>to containe nothing contrary to the Scriptures, Fathers, Councels, and Antiquities?</hi> Will he ſay it is a ſufficient iuſtification of this point, not to be driuen by force of argument, to confeſſe that it is againſt the Scriptures Fathers, &amp;c.? If he will ſay ſo, I make no doubt, but he hath or wil iuſtifie the conſecrations, and calling of their Bishops and Miniſters, to containe nothing contrary to the Scripture &amp;c. But though he be abſurd enough in many things, as will appeare hereafter, yet I cannot think him ſo abſurd as to affirme this. For ſo shall he be conſtrained to confeſſe, that
<pb facs="tcp:23816:5"/> the Arrians, and all the obstinate heretiques that euer haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, haue iuſtified their hereſies to containe nothing contrary to ſcripture &amp;c. none of them hauing yet euer bene constrained by force of argument, to confeſſe their doctrine to be contrary ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.</p>
            <p>He will peraduenture ſaie, that ouer and beſides this, he will shew the obiections made against their Bishops, to be but <hi>ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and odious imputations.</hi> But how will he shew this? by any other meanes, then by ſuch, as the Arrians, and all other heretiques pretended to shew, the arguments of the Catholique Doctors againſt their hereſies, to be but ſlanders? that is by making shew of framing ſome kind of anſwere to them, that they might not be ſaid to be ouercome, and forced to graunt the falſity of their hereſie. In this ſort ſurely and no other, doth M. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon iuſtifie the conſecration, and calling of their Bishops to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nothing contrary to ſcripture, as will appeare in the proceſſe of our diſpute.</p>
            <p>And now muſt I acquaint thee (good reader) with the reaſon for which, hauing vndertaken to prooue the nullity, of our new English Bishops their conſecrations, and calling, againſt M. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I enlarge my ſelfe ſo farre, as to diſprooue alſo that, of all the other falſly tearmed reformed churches; which reaſon is this. Knowing that the whole multitude of hereſies, that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſter the world at this time (as likewiſe all other which haue, or shalbee) are by no one kind of argument ſo eaſily and euidently refuted, as by that of the calling of their paſtors: And hauing occaſion offered me by M. Maſons brauing apology for the Proteſtant Bishops of England, to shew the nullity of their conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; Which though it haue the greatest outward appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of lawfull calling, of any other of the new ſtampe, and therfore it being refuted the reſt might be thaught to be ſufficiently refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it yet it being proper onlie to the pretended church of England, yea and not to that wholly (the Puritanes, Browniſts,
<pb facs="tcp:23816:6"/> Familians, and Anabaptiſts diſclaiming from it as papiſticall and ſuperſtitious) I conſidered that it was not to any great purpoſe, for the impugning of all theſe hereſies, to refell it alone and leaue the others vntouched. Therfore I reſolued to make this treatiſe generall, and to shew that no one of the new churches, called of the reformation, haue any true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and conſequently cannot be any true churches, nor ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue any true faith, or meanes of ſaluation. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in all good methode thoſe queſtions, that treate of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more generall, goe before thoſe that handle the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, therfore in my diſcourſe, haue thoſe questions the first place, that treate of the more generall points pertaining to this matter.</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe my purpoſe is ſpecially to diſprooue the calling, and conſecration of the Bishops in England, as well for that it is peculiar to our owne countrie, (and it being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprooued, the rest can haue no great probability, for that it hath more shew of true calling then all the rest) as alſo for that the calling of the miniſters of the French churches, which are the ſame with our Puritans, is already vnanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly refuted, by that famous prelate, and terrour of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques of thoſe daies Cardinall of Perron, in a proper trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of that ſubiect, ſet forth long ſince, yet neuer anſwered, and ſo much therof hereafter related, as pertaineth to the matter there in queſtion, for theſe reaſons (I ſay) I ſtand longer vpon that point by much, then vpon all the reſt. If M. Maſon or anie other, shall thinke good, to continue the defence of this cauſe, let him frame a pertinent anſwere to the arguments here propoſed, and he may expect a like reply, if God giue health and aſsiſtance. In the meane while if thou (cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous reader) canſt make any vſe of this my traueile, for the maintaining of the Catholique truth, and rooting out of the contrarie, either in thy ſelfe or others, I shall eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb facs="tcp:23816:6"/> my paines very ſufficiently recompenſed and ſo I commend thee to Gods holy grace.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Eſay 35.8.</note> which he hath no where promiſed in reſpect of theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How commeth it then to paſſe, (will ſome ſay) that ſo many doe daily erre, and many moe doe greatly complaine, of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23816:10"/> the difficulty in finding the true way to ſaluation: And not without reaſon as it ſeemeth, there being ſo many diuers waies propoſed, whereof euery one is auouched by ſome to be the only true way? The reaſon hereof is eaſily giuen, and the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the euil which it bringeth, as eaſily found, and not with much more difficulty practiſed, if men be willing to embrace it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The principall yea peraduenture the ſole reaſon, why ſo many (not only now adaies, but in all times) haue and doe goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray from the way of ſaluation erring <hi>from the true faith with out which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> and that many moe haue difficulty to finde the ſame: is becauſe they firſt ſeeke to know what they should beleeue, before they know, or ſeek to know whom they should beleeue, or of whom they should learne their faith and beliefe. This to ſome may peraduenture at the firſt, ſeeme ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improbable, or at leaſt doubtfull. Becauſe it may be thought little to import of whom a man knoweth, or is taught the truth, ſo that he know it indeed: as in the like caſe, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth little or nought at all, of whom, or by whoſe counſell or meanes a ſicke man recouereth his health, ſo that he be truely cured: or by whom he that is bound for Hieruſalem (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) is taught the way, ſo that he be shewed the true way. Yet that which I ſaid is moſt true, as shall manifeſtly appeare euen by theſe familiar examples propoſed. For if a ſicke man or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller should conſult and take directions, the one for his health, the other for his iourny, of ſuch as are as little skilfull in theſe matters as themſelues, are they not in euident danger to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued? And if they inquire of others, of whoſe knowledge they haue no more aſſurance, then of the firſt, they may well be brought into more doubt and perplexity (one telling them one thing, and another the quit contrary) but they shall be neuer a whit further, the one from danger of going aſtray in his iourney, the other from encreaſing his diſeaſe. Euident therfore it is, that the firſt thing theſe men are ro ſeeke, is to know, who can giue them true directions, and teach them how to finde that which they ſeeke, and which they deſire to finde.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And this will be much more euident, if wee put the caſe, that theſe men know, or at leaſt may moſt eaſily know, that there are appointed by publike authority men to direct and guide them in all their doubts and difficulties, whoſe direction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe two things (I ſay) ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it is moſt cleare, that hee that will not in theſe caſes be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, muſt neceſſarily firſt and before all things ſeeke to know who can truly inſtruct, and direct him in his doubts, as appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto by publike authority, that afterwards hee may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely learne of him or them what hee is to doe, and what courſe he is to hold, for the attayning of that he deſireth; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the recouery of his health, or the proſperous atchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his iourney.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Euen ſo and no otherwiſe doth it fare with all Chriſtians, in the great and weighty affaire of their eternall felicity. For there is no Chriſtian but either knoweth, or may moſt eaſily know theſe two things. Firſt that God hath authorized and eſtabliſhed here vpon earth publike Officers, and Paſtors to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and guid all men in the true way to life euerlaſting, and to teach them the only true faith: whoſe directions and conduct whoſoeuer followeth, shall not goe aſtray nor erre. Secondly, that there are others, who hauing no commiſſion or authority at all in theſe affaires, doe not withſtanding take vpon them the charge of Teachers and Guides in this weighty buſineſſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to haue more skill, and knowledge therein, (and therefore more right to that office and function) then the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely authorized Paſtours haue: but indeed, teaching falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and new waies of their owne inuention, lead all their followers into eternall ruine. There is nothing more euident and certaine, to thoſe that beleeue the holy Scriptures then theſe two things. For God by his wiſdome forſeeing that the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or error in either of theſe things could not ſtand with the true meane to bring men to life euerlaſting: (the errour in the firſt, taking away the meane to know, whom they should follow or beleeue; and the errour in the ſecond, not permitting them to know whom they should flie and auoid) hath himſelfe moſt clearely and euidently teſtified both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23816:11"/> any one that pretendeth to beleeue ſcripture, should be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by them, as we daily ſee many are. But the true reaſon hereof is that which was ſaid before, that men hauing ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their eternall felicity, doe not care what maſters they follow or of whom they learne their beliefe, and other things neceſſary for their ſaluation: whereas they should firſt with competent diligence ſeeke out thoſe maſters who are by ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne authority otdained to teach them, (who are not hard to be found, as shall by and by appeare) and then with like dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but with all ſecurity learne, what they ought to beleeue and doe. For ſeeing God hath ſo euidently teſtified that he hath prouided ſuch guides to direct vs in the true way to eternall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as following them we follow himſelfe; and further that if we follow any other teaching contrary to them, we shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low rauening wolues, what faire shew ſo euer they make: who can doubt but the firſt thing, that any man that deſireth to ſaue his ſoule, is to ſeeke to know who thoſe guides appointed by God are, that hauing found them, he may ſecurely learne of them the true way to euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Though this diſcourſe be of it ſelfe cleare, and euident, yet becauſe it is a certaine ground of that which is to be ſaid hereafter, it wil not be amiſſe to confirme it yet further, for which purpoſe ſerue moſt fitly theſe words of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.13.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoeuer shall inuocate the name of the Lord shall be ſaued, how then shall they inuocate him, in whom they haue not beleeued? or how shall they beleeue him whom they haue not heard? and how shall they heare without a Preacher? and how shall they preach vnleſſe they be ſent?</hi> Thus ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Whereby it is euident, that before we can know, what we ought to beleeue, we muſt firſt know, whom we ought to beleeue. For ſeeing we cannot (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) beleeue, vnleſſe we heare or be taught, and that we cannot heare and be taught by euerie one, but only by ſuch as are ſent, and authoriſed to teach vs, we muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, vnleſſe we wittingly be deceiued, firſt and before all things ſeeke to know, who thoſe are that haue commiſſion, warrant, and authoriry to teach vs, that of them we ſecurely learne what we are to beleeue.</p>
               <p>And this courſe or order of learning our faith, ſo plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in holy Scripture, is alſo moſt conformable to that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode which nature her ſelfe obſerueth in teaching vs naturall

So the heathen Philoſophers by the knowledge of Gods creatures roſe vp to the knowledge of their Creator,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth. Therefore it being a farre more eaſie thing, to know who thoſe are that are authoriſed, and appointed to teach vs our faith, then it is to know what our faith is, or what we ought to beleeue: As it is a farre more eaſie thing in any common-wealth, to know who is a true and lawfull iudge, then to know what is right iudgement in any difficult caſe in law. We are bound vnder paine of peruerting, not only Gods expreſſe ordinance, declared out of holy Scripture, but alſo the courſe of nature it ſelfe in learning our faith.

               <p n="8">8 The ſame thing is yet made more manifeſt by this euident reaſon.

For ſeeing there are ſome that read the holy Scriptures, and yet doe not find therin the neceſſity of Paſtors, though ſo expreſly contayned in them, as the places before cited doe shew they are, is it not eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they had neede of teachers, to make them ſee, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to them in holy Scriptures? For with thoſe, that make this obiection I would argue thus. Either you finde in the holy Scriptures the neceſſity of Paſtours, Doctors, and Teachers to be in Gods church, notwithſtanding the benefit of the written word of God, or you finde no ſuch thing at all: if you find it, then muſt you beleeue it, as being taught by Gods holy word, if you beleeue the Scripture: if you finde it not, then had you much more neede of Paſtours, and Doctours to teach you the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of holy Scripture, ſeeing you doe not finde in them that, which they ſo expreſly containe.</p>
               <p>Where it is to be obſerued, that this argument concludeth not only directly againſt thoſe, that admit not the neceſſity of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Doctours in Gods Church (if any should deny them) but alſo indirectly againſt thoſe that either ſay, the Paſtors may be iudged by their sheepe in matter of doctrine: or that the deciſion of the queſtion of the calling of Paſtours ought not neceſſarily goe before the deciſion of other queſtions of doctrine, when there is doubt of both. As for example, that the examination of this queſtion, whether <hi>Luther,</hi> had true calling, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was true Paſtour or no, ought not to goe before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of this point of his doctrine, whether after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> man haue freewill or no: and the like. For firſt, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently againſt the nature and inſtruction of Paſtours, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, to be guided and taught by thoſe ouer whom they haue the charge of Teachars and Gouernors. But if they chance to erre, they are to be taught and iudged by other Paſtours, and not by their own sheepe: becauſe the Diſciple cannot be aboue his maſter. Secondly, when any one is found to teach new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and is not knowne from whence he commeth, or who ſent him to preach that doctrine, his calling and commiſſion is firſt of all to be examined, and afterwards his doctrine; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23816:13"/> not firſt his doctrine, and then his calling. And the reaſon is, not only becauſe it is more eaſie to know when a man hath true calling,<note place="margin">Act. n. 7.</note> then which is true doctrine (as is ſaid before) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men are not ſo ſubiect to be deceiued in the one as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but alſo becauſe, if hee be found without true calling, let his doctrine be neuer ſo true, he shall be eſteemed a rebell and traytor to God and his Church, and all thoſe that follow him, and therefore can haue no right to diſpute of doctrine as a Paſtor but ought to heare and learne of the true Paſtours as a sheepe, though he eſteeme himſelfe neuer ſo fit and able to teach others. <hi>For not he that commendeth himſelfe is approued,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.17</note> 
                  <hi>but whom God commendeth</hi> As in the like cauſe euery officer or magiſtrate executing any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the name of the Prince, muſt firſt shew his letters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath power to execute that office, before he can iuſtifie his proceedings in the ſame, whether they be according to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or noe.<note place="margin">See the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon heerof in the <hi>2.</hi> and <hi>3.</hi> cap. n. <hi>2.</hi>

This ground being laid as partly confeſſed of all parts, and proued by manifeſt teſtimony of holy Scripture, and euident naturall reaſon, it only remaineth to ſearch out by what aſſured meanes they may be knowne, who are by Gods ſoueraigne power and authority, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued and appointed to teach and gouerne his people in true faith, or in the true way to ſaluation, which being no harder to be knowne, (as by the enſuing diſcourſe, shall appeare) then the ciuill magiſtrates, and officers in any common-wealth or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, are knowne and diſcerned from vſurpers, and intruders; the way to eternall felicity will appeare to be <hi>ſo plaine and direct as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foolish</hi> (vnleſſe they be wilfully and wittingly blind) <hi>cannot goe aſtray therein.</hi>

The Proteſtants agree with the Catholiques firſt, that the office and charge of preaching, and miniſtring Sacraments in Gods church, requireth neceſſarily a ſpeciall power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to the lawfull and auailable exerciſe therof. Which is to ſay that if any man vndertake to exerciſe the ſame, not hauing ſuch authoritie, his fact shall not only be vnlawfull and wicked, but alſo voide and without all effect, as being deſtitute of ſufficient power and commiſſion, They therefore that shall attempt any ſuch fact, without authoritie, and not only they, but all their followers and fauourers, are guiltie of ſacrilegiouſe rebellion againſt God and his church. And the reaſon is manifeſted. For who ſoeuer exerciſeth any office not in his owne, but in another mans name, and doth it without his warrant and commiſſion, doth him manifeſt iniury, vſurping his authoritie (the moſt valued and eſteemed right that any man enioyeth:) and if the thing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted be of moment, and the partie whoſe authoritie is vſurped, be his ſoueraigne, as both happen in this caſe of preaching, and miniſtring Sacraments in the church, the vſurper and all his abettors, by the auow of all men, cannot be but guiltie of treaſon, and manifeſt rebellion. For fuller confirmation and declaration wherof (though manifeſt in it ſelfe, and not denied by the Proteſtants themſelues) becauſe it is a point of exceeding conſequence, it will not be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, to bring one ſuch teſtimonie of holy ſcripture, as may ſerue both for an inſtruction, and motiue to all ſorts of men to abhorre ſuch ſacrilegious vſurpation.

               <p n="1">1. IN this chapter (as likewiſe in thoſe that follow) is mention only made of preaching and miniſtring ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not becauſe theſe be the only functions belonging vnto the paſtors of Gods church, but becauſe theſe are graunted by all Proteſtants to belong to that office, and are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the deciding of the preſent controuerſie, without inuoluing other queſtions, (of power to offer ſacrifice, to make lawes or canons,) not neceſſarie for this purpoſe. Which obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation made; for the reſolution of the queſtion propoſed, I ſuppoſe (as a thing ſo cleare and euident, as can neede no proofe) that there is ſome certaine meanes, wherby both Paſtors may ſo fully and ſufficiently proue their lawfull miſſion, that they to whom they are ſent, cannot iuſtly doubt therof; and alſo wherby Chriſtian people may be ſo aſſured of their canonicall calling, that they neede not ſtand in feare, to receiue a woolf or a theefe in ſteed of a Paſtor or Shepheard, at leaſt, forſomuch as belongeth to his calling or commiſſion. For if there were no ſuch aſſured meanes to know this, our ſauiour Chriſt should haue ſmall reaſon ſo often to warne his people to beware of falſe prophets, woolues, theeues, and robbers. For how can
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23816:16"/> they beware of them, whom they haue no ſufficient meanes to know? And likewiſe how can the people of God auoide that dangerous hazard, of deſpiſing both our ſauiour Chriſt, and his eternall father; in deſpiſing thoſe whom he ſendeth, to whom he ſaith.<note place="margin">Luc. 10.16.</note> 
                  <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth mee?</hi> How can (I ſay) Chriſtian people auoide this danger, vnles there be ſome certaine and aſſured meane to know whom he ſendeth, and to diſcerne them from thoſe, that come of themſelues, being ſent by none. This preſuppoſed, the difficulty of this queſtion is not great.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For euident and certayne it is, that albeit a man be iudged, neuer ſo fit and able to vndergo the charge and office of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, he hath not for all that, that calling, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, and authority, which is neceſſarilie required, for the lawfull and auailable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that function, the holy Ghoſt expreſly teaching that <hi>none can preach vnleſſe they be ſent:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.15. Hebr. 5.4.</note> and that <hi>none can take vpon them this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice but ſuch as are called of God as Aaron was.</hi> For the more eaſie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the reaſon herof, it is to bee noted; That the lawfull and auailable exerciſe of any office, either ciuill or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, is not like vnto the exerciſe of an arte or trade, which after a man hath learned, and is skilfull therin, he may lawfully vſe, (ſome certaine formalities, which ciuill policy hath brought in, in ſome places obſerued) yea if without the obſeruation of theſe formalities, he exerciſe his trade, that which he shall do, is not void, and of none effect, but is truly and auailablie done. As for example, if a carpenter, which is not free of <hi>London,</hi> should build a houſe in <hi>London,</hi> he may, according to the ſtatutes of the citie, be amerced or fined, but yet the houſe, which he ſet vp, shall remayne a howſe. But it is otherwiſe in the exerciſe of any office, either Eccleſiaſticall or ciuill. For if one that is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and approued iugde for example; should giue ſentence in any caſe either ciuill or criminall, his fact should not only be vnlawfull, but vneffectuall yea none at all, though he should giue a true ſentence. And this not for any other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanteth the true authoritie of a iudge: the ſame reaſon holdeth equally at leaſt in the exerciſe of ſpirituall or eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall offices. And the true reaſon herof is, becauſe the skill, fitnes, or abilitie to exerciſe any office, whether ciuill or eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall is a farre different thing, from the power and authority, wherby the officer is authoriſed to exerciſe the ſame; that, being
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23816:16"/> or ought to be preſuppoſed, this ſuperadded. For the Prince, when he maketh any Officer or Magiſtrate, doth not make him fit for it, but finding or thinking him fit, giueth him authority and power to exerciſe it. A man being made fit for any office by nature, arte, induſtrie, or grace, is notwithſtanding made Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer by the grant, patent, or appointment of him, who hath power to giue it. And therfore we ſee, that all that are iudged fit to beare office, either in the church or common-wealth, are not foorthwith Officers. The function therfore of preaching Gods word, and miniſtering Gods Sacraments, being not only an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but the greateſt in that kind, that euer was imparted to man, it doth neceſſarilie require authority, and power for the lawfull, and auailable exerciſe therof, without which no fitneſſe, neither of nature, arte, nor grace (the ordinarie courſe of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ordinance remaining) ſufficing otherwaies to make it good and lawfull.

For if it were lawfull for euery ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and vnruly ſpirit, to ſuggeſt againſt the eſtablished gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and gouernors, what he liſt, vnder the colour of neceſſary reformation: and his ſuggeſtions being reiected by the ſoueraigne maieſtrates as ſeditious and wicked, might appeale from their ſentence, as parties and might caſt himſelfe vpon the triall of the law, and that to be vnderſtood no otherwaies then he will haue

Which in conuenience in the ſpirituall or eccleſiaſticall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods church, is by ſo much more hurtfull and hatefull, then in the temporall gouernment of any common-wealth (but that men are leſſe carefull of thoſe things, that appertain to their eternall felicity then in thoſe that touch their temporall weale) by how much more domageable it is to looſe the inheritance of the kingdome of heauen, then to looſe ſome ſmall temporall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in this world.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus refuted this ſeditious doctrine of <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis,</hi> (which doubtleſſe was firſt hatched there, where there is no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but all horror and confuſion) I wil now examin his grounds whereupon it is built. But by the way I will aduertiſe thee (care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Reader) that he bringeth nothing at all, for the eſtablishing of his doctrine, whereupon he groundeth this large commiſſion of calling: but ſuch ſtuffe as the Arians, Neſtorians, Pelagians, and all other condemned heretikes whatſoeuer might haue brought againſt the Catholike chutch, and which the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts and Libertines, (who <hi>Monſieur du Pleſſis</hi> eſteemeth heretikes) may alleadge for themſelues againſt him, which only obſeruation is more then ſufficient, to ouerturne all that he ſaith to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

But let vs come more neere vnto him.</p>
               <p>His <hi>ſimile</hi> faileth fowly in diuers reſpects. Firſt for that the pretended Reformers doe not diſcouer fire in the City, or the enimies ſcaling the Wals, but would gladly caſt and kindle fire, and ſcale the wals of Gods church: or if it be otherwaies, let them shew ſome euident difference, betwixt their entrie, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to enter, and of thoſe that they themſelues condemne for firebrands, and enemies of Gods church, which they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what man of ordinary ſenſe will ſay, that it is as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie a thing to diſcerne errour in doctrine of faith, or abuſe in the Church gouernment, as it is to diſcerne fire in the towne, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſcaling the wals, (which muſt be ſuppoſed for truth, or elſe this argument is nothing worth) ſeeing this is a matter of ſenſe, wherein none is deceiued, and that a matter of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and iudgement, wherein the wiſeſt, and greateſt clarkes haue erred, as witneſſe the laps of <hi>Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and <hi>Lucifer,</hi> to omit an infinite number of heretikes, who were not of meane vnderſtanding, if they had had grace withall?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this argument ſuppoſeth, that the watch of the Church may be ſo a ſleepe, that the enemies may ſurpriſe it, the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23816:21"/> watchmen (that is, the Paſtors) being not aware thereof, which is directly againſt the Scripture, aſſuring vs the contrary.<note place="margin">Eſay 62.6.</note>

Wherefore with all reaſon, are ſuch as come, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to aduertiſe the Church of neceſſary reformation, firſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined whence they came, who ſent them, what commiſſion they haue?

                  <hi>The fifth Chapter.</hi> That the truth of doctrine is not a ſufficient proofe of true and lawfull calling, to the miniſtery of Gods word, and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Nor is it any aſſured meanes for a Preacher and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, to prooue himſelfe authentically called to that charge, for him to alleage that the doctrine which he teacheth is good and true.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HAVING proued in the precedent chapter, that the ſole opinion of the fitneſſe of any perſon, to exerciſe the miniſtery of Gods word, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, ioyned alſo with an opinion, that ſuch as are in that charge, doe not rightly diſcharge it, is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant for any man, to take vpon himſelfe that office, it followeth, that we examine whether euery one, that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, to teach true doctrine, hath true and lawfull calling, to the miniſtery of Gods word. And the ſenſe of the queſtion is: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, that should haue no other proofe of their calling, to the miniſtery of Gods word and ſacraments in his church, then that which is drawne from the nature, and quality of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and manner of miniſtring the ſacraments, in this ſort: <hi>The doctrine which we preach and maner of miniſtring the ſacraments, which we vſe, is true and conformable to Gods written word: therefore our calling to preach and miniſter the ſacraments, is lawfully, and ſufficiently warranted.</hi> The queſtion here (I ſay) is, whether this be a ſufficient proofe of calling, to the lawfull miniſtery of Gods word and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the clearing whereof it is to be obſerued, that two conditions are neceſſarily required in that whereby another thing is to be proued. The firſt is, that it be better knowne or more euident, then that which is to be proued by it. For it is an euident abſurdity to proue one thing vnknowne, by another thing, that is as little, or leſſe knowne. As for example, if one should proue the ſtarres in the firmament, to be euen or of equal number, becauſe they are not odde; or if one should prooue
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23816:30"/> himſelfe no baſtard, becauſe he is borne in lawfull wedlocke, the latter being no better knowne then the former, which should be proued by it? or (which is more to our purpoſe) if one should proue himſelfe to be a lawfull iudge or iuſtice, becauſe hee iudgeth all cauſes according to equity and iuſtice; I ſay, that theſe, and all other ſuch like proofes whereby we would prooue the matter, which is in doubt and in queſtion being as little or leſſe certaine then that, which we would prooue by them, are euidently abſurd, and of no force. For in this caſe, that which should be proued, is made no better knowne, nor no more certaine, then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The ſecond condition required in that thing, which is to be the proofe of another, is, that it be alwaies certainly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ibly ioyned with that, which is to be proued, (if we ſpeake of certaine, and infallible proofes, as here we doe): for though one thing should be more euident, and better knowne then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet vnleſſe it be found alwaies ioyned with the other, it cannot make any certaine, and infallible proofe of it. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it is more euident to him, that ſeeth a tree bloſſomed, that it is bloſſomed, then that it will beare fruit: and that a man, whom we ſee moue, doth verily moue, then that he doth ride on horsbacke, and yet neither is that an infallible and certaine proofe, that the tree bloſſomed, will bring fruit: nor this, that the man which moueth, doth ride on horsbacke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither the one, nor the other, is alwaies certainely ioyned with that, which should be proued. This being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note>3. It is euident, that it cannot be any conuenient, or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofe of lawfull calling, to the miniſtery of Gods word, and ſacraments, to alledge or affirme, that the parties, whoſe calling is in diſpute, as doubtfull and vncertaine, doe teach true doctrine, and miniſter rightly the ſacraments. And the reaſon is eaſie; becauſe in this proofe, is neither of the conditions, whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, and therefore is it not only inſufficient but very idle and abſurd. But let vs ſee, how neither of thoſe conditions is found in this proofe.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is no leſſe vncertaine and vnknowne, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23816:30"/> preached by any new maſter is true, and conformable to the holy Scriptures, then that his calling, who preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, is good and lawfull: yea vnles it be the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, with that of the whole Catholique Church, (as if it be new, it cannot be) it muſt needs be farre more vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and more difficult to know, then is his calling, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be no ſufficient proofe thereof. For whether the proofe of doctrine conſiſt in the conformity, with the true ſenſe and meaning of the written word only, as the Proteſtants teach, or of the vnwritten, and written word together, as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques beleeue, euident it is, that the proofes of doctrin, drawne from thence muſt needs be farre more difficult, then are thoſe of calling becauſe the difficultie, in finding out the true ſenſe of holy ſcripture, is farre greater, then that, which is in trying out the true calling of any Paſtor; as euidently appeareth, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well by the confeſſion, and example of the greateſt wits, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue beene in the Chriſtian world; ſome willingly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing great difficulty, in finding out the true ſenſe, and meaning of the holy Scripture: <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> the Eagle of the Latine Church, with admiration confeſſing the profoundneſſe of Gods word, breaketh forth into theſe words. <hi>O wonderfull profoundneſſe of thy words: wonderfull profoundneſſe (my God) wonderfull profoundneſſe,</hi>

Neither doth the anſwer, which the Proteſtants vſe to make to this, any way ſatisfie, ſaying; that though there be many hard paſſages in holy ſcripture, yet are they either expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in other places more eaſie, or elſe they doe not containe any other points of doctrine neceſſary to be knowne, then thoſe that are contayned in the more eaſie places: This anſwere (I ſay) doth no way ſatisfie. For beſides that euery place of ſcripture contayneth <hi>doctrine profitable to teach, to argue, to correct, to instruct in iuſtice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. ad Timo. 3.16.</note> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, (and therefore not only the eaſie, but the hard places alſo): the many expoſitions giuen by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, contrary to the vnderſtanding not only of the Catholikes, but alſo of other Proteſtants, vpon diuers places of ſcripture, contayning chief points of faith, as for example of theſe words: <hi>This is my body:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> to omit the miſunderſtanding of holy Scriptures, by all former heretikes: (the true cauſe of all hereſies, as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine ſaith) doe euidently shew the great difficulty, in finding out the true ſenſe, and meaning of Scriptures, euen in places contayning points of doctrine neceſſary to be knowne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, and therefore this their anſwer is both falſe and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.<note place="margin">De doctrina Chriſtiana li. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> And though S. Auguſtine ſaith, <hi>that nothing almoſt is drawne out of thoſe obſcurities, which may not be found in other places vttered plainly:</hi> yet is neither his ſaying vniuerſall, as is euident by that word (almoſt) neither is his meaning ſuch, as that without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Church, all the plainer places of ſcripture may be eaſily vnderſtood: As the variety of interpretations oppoſite to the true meaning of the Scripture, and therefore cauſing he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies as the ſame S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, doth euidently conuince. And thus much of the difficulty of finding out the true ſenſe of Gods words, from whence the proofe of doctrine is to be had. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth, that we now ſee, what difficulty there is in finding out the proofe of true and lawful calling, that afterwards it may appeare, whether the truth of doctrine, may be a conuenient proofe of calling, or no.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the proofe of calling there is neither other difficulty nor miſtery, then that he, that pretendeth to be lawfull Paſtor, Preacher, or miniſter of Gods word, and ſacraments, doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome authenticall inſtrument, or teſtimony witneſſing, that he is put in that charge by him, that is confeſſed to haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to giue it, That this is the only knowne, and common way
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23816:31"/> of making proofe, of the ordinary calling to the miniſtery, there is none of the Proteſtants, that deny it. I ſay of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for of that only I ſpeake here, leauing the extraordinary to another place. This being ſo, no man of any iudgement will ſay, that it is a more plaine, and eaſie thing to know, what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is conformable to the true ſenſe and meaning of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; then to know, who hath lawfull calling of the miniſtery of Gods word and ſacraments: but the quite contrary: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the allegation of the truth of Doctrine, or the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity thereof with the word of God, cannot be any competent or conuenient proofe of lawfull calling, according to the grounds propoſed, in the beginning of the Chapter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And this is manifeſt by this cleare example. No ciuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and in particuler, no iudge or iuſtice, was yet euer found ſo extrauagant, as to proue himſelfe true and lawfull iudge, by the right, and iuſt deciding of cauſes: But before any man can or dare to take vpon him to ſit in iudgement, as a publique iuſtice, vpon any matter, be it ciuill or criminall, he produceth his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or warrant, whereby it authentically appeareth, that he is eſtablished in that charge, by the ſoueraigne authority of the Prince: without which neither the alleadging nor the manifeſt proofe, both of his skill, and equity in deciding of cauſes, would auaile him for the proof of his calling to that charge. Yea though he were furnished with both kinde of proofes, to wit, as well with that of skill, and equity in iudgments, as with that of the Kings patent, yet who ſeeth not, that the latter is not onely a more certaine and authenticall, but alſo a more eaſie, and plaine proofe of his eſtablishing in that office. For to diſcerne this, the only view of the Kings authenticall patent or other writ, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed in thoſe affaires, with a ſmall knowledge is ſufficient; whereas to diſcerne the other, the skill as well in the nature of cauſes, as alſo in the tenour of the Law, (which is found in few) is required. And therefore he that should proue his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and powre in this caſe, by his good behauiour in his office, should prooue that, which is more cleere and eaſie to be known, by that which is farre more obſcure, and more difficult, which to the ſight of all men, is ridiculus and abſurd. And this is true, though we should ſuppoſe, that the proofe of his knowledge, and ſincerity in exerciſing that office, should be ſufficient profe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:23816:32"/> of his lawfull calling, and eſtablishing therein: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is farre otherwaies, as will euidently appeare by that which followeth. The like abſurdity they commit, that labour to proue their lawfull calling to the miniſtery, by the truth of their doctrine, and manner of miniſtring the Sacraments, though there doctrine were knowne, to be moſt conformable to holy ſcripture, and their manner of miniſtring the ſacraments likewiſe approued.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But our new Reformiſts doe commit a farre more groſſe and foule abſurdity. For the truth of their doctrine, and their manner of miniſtring ſacraments, being as much in doubt and diſpute, as their calling, is it not more then abſurd to produce the truth of their doctrine, for proofe of their lawfull calling? And is not this proofe altogether like vnto that, whereby the ſtarres in the firmament, should be proued to be euen in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe they be not odde, this being as vncertaine as the other? And yet there is this difference, betwixt theſe two proofes, that he that should indeed proue the ſtarres not to be odde, should ſufficiently prooue them to be euen: Whereas he that should proue the Proteſtants doctrine to be true, should not for all that proue their calling to be good, as shall be shewed by and by.</p>
               <p>Hitherto it hath beene shewed, that the proofe of calling to the miniſtery, by the truth of doctrine, is inconuenient and abſurd, though the doctrine should be admitted for true. But in the caſe of our aduerſaries, where the truth of doctrine is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in controuerſie, it is moſt ridiculous and impertinent. But now let vs conſider the ſecond condition neceſſarily required in a lawfull proofe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Where there is true doctrine, there is not alwaies law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling, to the miniſtery of Gods word and ſacraments: and therefore the proofe of calling by the truth of doctrine, faileth in the ſecond condition neceſſarily required in a lawfull proofe: and is like to this. <hi>Peter</hi> is learned in the Law, and an honeſt man, therefore a lawfull iudge: or <hi>Iohn</hi> is a valiant captaine, and faithfull ſubiect, therefore the Kings Lieutenant generall. For the truth of doctrine doth no more inferre the lawfulneſſe of calling, to miniſter Gods word, and ſacraments, then the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23816:32"/> knowledge of the Law, or skill in martiall affaires, ioyned with honeſty, and fidelity, doe inferre the office of iudge or Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant.</p>
               <p>It is euident by many inſtances out of holy ſcripture, that the the truth of doctrine is not alwaies with lawfull calling to miniſtery of Gods word and ſacraments. For <hi>S. Mathias</hi> before he was choſen to be an Apoſtle, had doubtleſſe the ſame doctrine, that the other Apoſtles had, and yet had he not any lawfull Apoſtle-ship. And <hi>S. Ioſeph</hi> ſurnamed the iuſt, who was choſen to ſtand with <hi>S. Mathias</hi> for the Apoſtle-ship,<note place="margin">Act. c. 1.</note> from which <hi>Iudas</hi> fell, had no doubt the ſame truth of doctrine, that <hi>S. Mathias</hi> had, and the reſt, yet was he not an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the reſt of our Sauiours Diſciples, and of thoſe of the Apoſtles, who though they had the truth of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yet were they not for all that al owed for lawfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and Preachers, vntill they were ordayned thereunto by the Apoſtles, or thoſe that had that power from them. For why did S. <hi>Paul</hi> leaue <hi>Titus in Creete,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. c. 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>to ordaine Priests in all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as he had appointed:</hi> but becauſe more is required to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power of Prieſt-hood, then truth of doctrine? whence it is manifeſt that whereſoeuer is true doctrine, there is not alwaies lawfull calling, to the miniſterie of Gods word and ſacraments. Which is yet more euident by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Core</hi> and his complices, who differed not from <hi>Moiſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in any point of doctrine, or manner of Sacraments, ſacrifice or ceremonies, but onely in the vſurpation of that function, whereunto they were not called, for the which they were ſo ſeuerely punished, as is before mentioned.

               <p n="9">9. By theſe irreprouable teſtimonies both of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the ancient Fathers, it is euident, that the truth of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, cannot be any ſufficient proofe of lawfull calling to the miniſtery of Gods word, and Sacraments. And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the truth of doctrine, and lawfull calling proceed from principles, that are different in themſelues, and not ſo dependent one of the other, but that the one may be well without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the truth of doctrine is taken from the conformity it hath with Gods reuealed word: but the calling of Paſtors, or commiſſion to miniſter lawfully Gods word, and ſacraments, is receiued from the perſon of our Sauiour Chriſt (to whom all power is giuen in heauen, and in earth) by ſuch meanes as he hath ordayned, and inſtituted for that purpoſe, whereof there is frequent mention in holy Scriptures, as we shall ſee more at large hereafter. Which being ſo, no maruel it is, that the one may be without the other, and conſequently that the one cannot be any certaine, or ſure proofe of the other. And this diuerſity of principles or beginnings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence the truth of doctrin, &amp; lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of calling do proceed, is made more manifeſt by the example before mentioned of a ciuil magiſtrate. For the equity and iuſtnes of euery ſentence, or iudgment in caſes of the law, is taken from the conformity it hath, with the law it ſelfe, and with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the caſe decided; And the authority of the iudge is r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For though the lawfull calling to preach, and miniſter Gods ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth preſuppoſe truth of doctrine, with other qualities requiſite, or at leaſt ought to doe, yet doth not truth of doctrine neceſſarily inferre lawfull power to preach, as is manifeſt by that which is already ſaid.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But here may be made a cauill in this manner. This queſtion, <hi>What is calling?</hi> neceſſarily goeth before this other;<note place="margin">A cauill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.</note> 
                  <hi>where is lawfull calling, or who hath lawfull calling?</hi> For it is in vaine to aske where it is; vnleſſe it be firſt knowne what it is; But this queſtion, <hi>what is calling?</hi> is a point of doctrine, and not of calling, or authority, and therefore queſtions of doctrine muſt, or ought to goe before thoſe of calling, and conſequently truth of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may be proofe of calling. And becauſe queſtions of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are to be decided by ſcripture, therefore is this queſtion alſo to be tried by Scripture. For the ſatisfying of this cauill, it is to be obſerued. Firſt, that though this queſtion: <hi>What is calling?</hi> be a queſtion of doctrine, and neceſſarily goeth before this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>where is calling or who hath it?</hi> yet doth it not therefore follow that all queſtions of doctrin, ought to goe before all thoſe of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. As in the like caſe, though this queſtion, <hi>what is lawful iuridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power?</hi> be a queſtion, of law, not of power, or authority, and neceſſarily goeth before this other, <hi>who is a lawful iudge, or who hath lawful iuridical power?</hi> yet doth it not therfore follow, that all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of law are, or ought to be decided before this queſtion of power or office, to wit, <hi>who is a lawful iudge or who hath the lawful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to iudge?</hi> But when this is in doubt, it muſt necſſarily be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before all others, excepting that one, <hi>what is a lawful iudge?</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without the deciſion of this queſtion, <hi>who is lawful iudge?</hi> no other queſtions in law can be rightly, &amp; iuridically decided: and the ſame happeneth in our queſtion of Eccleſiaſticall calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is to be obſerued, that the difference or diſpute, between vs, and our aduerſaries is not about this queſtion: <hi>What is lawful calling?</hi> For in this we all agree, to wit, that it is the lawful power to miniſter the word of God, &amp; ſacraments, in the church of Chriſt, therfore is not neceſſary to be diſputed, it being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by either party. But the difference between vs is, where this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23816:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> lawfull power is, or who hath it. To wit, whether the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants haue it, or no: Which is the firſt queſtion of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that by all right, and lawful proceeding, ought to be decided betwixt vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is to be obſerued that though the Scripture doth ſufficiently expreſſe both what this calling is, and by what means it is giuen, and deriued to thoſe, that are made Paſtors, as alſo the temporal law doth the office of a ciuil magiſtrate: yet doth it not nor can it expreſſe, who or what particuler perſon hath this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For this neceſſarily includeth a matter of fact, which is as often repeated, as there is any new Paſtor created, and therfore cannot be expreſſed in holy ſcriptures: as neither can the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral law declare, what perſon in particuler is true &amp; lawful iudge, or iuſtice. So that we may truly ſay, that the ſcripture doth declare what is calling, but it doth not, nor cannot declare where it is, or who hath it. And again, that it doth indeed declare it, but it doth not giue it, as neither doth the temporall law giue the ciuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>trate his office. Therfore though it be true, that this queſtion <hi>where is this calling?</hi> be to be decided by ſcripture; yet this other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: <hi>where is this calling? or who hath it?</hi> which is only in controuerſie here, cannot be decided by Scripture, becauſe this includeth, or ſuppoſeth a matter of fact, which the Scripture cannot expreſſe. But now I wil go forward with my purpoſe, whence I may ſeem to haue ſomwhat digreſſed, by reaſon of the obiection made and anſwered.</p>
               <p n="11">11. This kind of proofe of calling, by the truth of doctrin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo euidently impertinent and defectiue, as is already shewed, ſome that are not ſo throughly acquainted, with the abſurd shifts of our new Reformiſts, may peraduenture thinke that they vſe it not at all, but that they are wronged by this imputation: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will not be amiſſe to ſet downe their owne words, that they may be heard ſpeake in their owne cauſe.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to a demand of their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Firſt certaine Miniſters of the pretended Reformation in <hi>France</hi> ſay thus. <hi>If there were no other reaſon, to prooue our vocation to be good, this would ſuffice, to wit, that we haue the true, and pure doctrine whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereupon the true calling doth depend.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23816:34"/> though we haue it not from others.</hi> Theſe are the ſelfe words of theſe new Paſtors, and <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis</hi> ſaith the ſame in effect, when he ſaith, <hi>that to thoſe, that aske them for their calling, they may anſwer in one word after our Sauiour, the words which we preach, beare witneſſe of vs:</hi> which is a text of Scripture of his owne coyning, as is before noted. All which ſufficiently sheweth, that they would prooue their calling, by the truth of their doctrine.</p>
               <p>But how ridiculous this argument of theirs is, euery child may ſee. We haue (ſay they) the true doctrine. (well for diſputations ſake, we will ſuppoſe it ſo, though in it ſelf it be moſt falſe) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſay they) may we haue true calling. Be it ſo what then? doth it follow hereupon, that they haue true calling? As well ſurely as if one should ſay, I am a true marchant, and may haue a thouſand pounds in my purſe, therefore I haue ſo much in my purſe. Who would not laugh at the vanity of this fellow? And whereas they ſeeme to brag, that they haue other proof of their vocation beſides the truth of their doctrin, when they ſay: <hi>if there were no other proofe of our vocation, then the truth of our doctrine:</hi> it is but a vaine brag of theirs, for they haue none at all, as is inuincibly proued againſt them, by their owne publike confeſſion, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the world for a declaration of their faith in theſe words. <hi>we beleeue that no man ought to intrude himſelfe into the church gouernment,</hi>

                  <hi>but that this be done by election (ſo far as is poſsible, and as God doth permit) which exception we wittingly adde, becauſe it hath bin needful ſomtimes, and namely in theſe our daies, when the ſtate of the Church was interrupted, that God should raiſe men by an extraordinary meanes to redres his church, which was in ruine, and deſolation.</hi> This is the publike confeſſion of their faith, whereby they openly profeſſe themſelues, to haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vocation, but extraordinary.

All which being well waied, it cannot be much marueiled that the Reformiſts would make ſome shew of proof of their vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the truth of their doctrine. For being on the one ſide deſtitute of all other proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof, and on the other ſide knowing right wel, that if they should once confeſſe themſelues to haue no calling at all (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they haue not, but come of themſelues, being ſent by none) they should quickly be diſcried to be falſe prophets, and ſuch, as in the holy ſcripture are called <hi>wolues, theeues</hi> and <hi>robbers,</hi> they are neceſſarily conſtrayned, to vſe this abſurd shift of prouing their calling,<note place="margin">Io. 10.1.2.</note> by the pretended truth of their doctrine. The abſurdity wherof, though euident to euery one, that with any ſmal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion waigheth it, yet is it not ſo apparant, but to ſuch, as either are preuented with a preiudicate opinion, of the corruption of the Roman Church, which they impugne, or to ſuch, as through careleſſenes of their owne eternal good (of which ſort the world is full) will not ſtand to weigh the vanity, and leuity therof, it may ſeeme ſufficient. This apparent shift therfore they willingly, and craftily vſe, that vnder the colour thereof (if it be poſſible) they may paſſe this point of their vocation, which is ſuch a ſtraite, as being kept with any indifferent ward, they know they can neuer paſſe: and therefore is by our Sauiour Chriſt called <hi>the doore of the sheep-fold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Io. 10.1.2.</note> which being by any ſlight once paſſed, they are ſtraight in the maine diſpute of doctrine. Wherein though they haue no more ground of truth, then they haue true calling, yet are they not ſo eaſily, and euidently conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of falshood and error (to the capacity of euery one) as they are of the nullity of their vocation. For as it is far more eaſie to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23816:35"/> keep the dore, that the theefe enter not into the sheepfold, then to thruſt him out again, being once entered, ſo is it far more eaſie to conuince all heretiks, of their intruſion, and want of calling (which is, as it were, to keepe them out of dores: then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince them of falſe doctrine, and error in faith, which is, to truſt them out againe, after they be once entered. And the reaſon hereof, (for ſo much as concerneth our controuerſie with the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Reformers) is euident. For they not admitting any other triall of doctrine, the then words of the ſcripture, and thoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted and vnderſtood, as they themſelues will, it is no maruell though they cannot eaſily be conuinced, of error in doctrine, (I ſay) conuinced ſo, as they haue no euaſion: which is not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the hereſie of theſe daies, but common to all hereſies, that euer haue beene. For neuer were there any heretikes, that did not alleage ſcripture for themſelues, which if we should ſuppoſe to be vnderſtood in no other ſenſe, and meaning, but as they did vnderſtand it; no maruell would it be, though they could not eaſely be conuinced of error and falſitie. And for a pregnant proofe heerof, may ſerue the example of that ſilly Arian <hi>Legate,</hi> not long ſince burned in Smith-field, whom all the Doctors and Bishops in England, could not conuince of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie by only ſcripture, at leaſt as he though. Wheras in the point of calling, there is no ſuch meanes, either by obſtinate wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or falſe pretence of ſcripture, to caſt duſt into mens eies, and to make their caſe if not probable, at leaſt doubtfull. For vnleſſe they bring forth the ſenſible teſtimonie of their calling, by the knowne Paſtors of the church, they are immediatlie without farther proofe, or triall, knowne to be intruders, and rauening wolues. And this is the very true reaſon, why our new maſters would ſo gladly skip ouer the point of voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (wherin they know they cannot hide their woluish fangues) and at the firſt leape, iumpe into the diſpute of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, where they know that only obſtinacie, and wilfulnes, and a reſolution to ſtand to no iudgment, but their owne, will furnish them of ſufficient meanes, to wrangle till the worlds end.

               <p n="6">6. Hauing thus refuted this abſurd point of Doctrine, of <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis,</hi> by authenticall proofe of the contrarie, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to shew the impertinency of his arguments, which he bringeth for confirmation of the ſame. His firſt argument is this in effect: It is no more ſtrange for a Paſtor, to be called to the holy miniſterie, by the people in time of neceſſitie, then it is for a ciuill Magiſtrate, to be choſen by them in the like neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie. But this is nothing ſtrange; neither therfore is the other. Wherunto I anſwere, that it is a moſt groſſe abſurditie, and ignorance to compare the Eccleſiaſticall miniſterie, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie, with the temporall, or ciuill in this point: thone being a meere ſpirituall power, to miniſter, and diſpenſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, hauing their effect in mens ſoules, which as they can only be inſtituted of God, ſo alſo can they only be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie diſpenſed by him, who is ordayned by God, and therfore the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>Let men ſo eſteeme of vs, as miniſters of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and diſpenſers of the miſteries of God.</hi> Thother is a meere temporall power, ouer mens bodies and goods, which no doubt may be giuen by men, as we ſee in the firſt inſtitution of kingdomes, or common wealthes. As therfore it is vnpoſſible for any one, to giue that vnto another, which he hath neither of himſelf, nor by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion from any other, ſo is it vnpoſſible for the people, to giue to others the authority, to miniſter Gods word and ſacraments, which they haue neither of themſelues, nor by any commiſſion from God: or if they haue, let it be shewed, where this power and commiſſion was giuen them. For as <hi>none doth take vnto himſelfe the honour of Prieſt-hood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>but he that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23816:39"/> is called of God, as</hi> Aaron (as the Apoſtle ſaith.) So doubtleſſe much leſſe doth any man take vpon him to giue this authority, but he which receiueth it from God, who is the ſole author thereof.</p>
               <p>His ſecond argument is this: Philip <hi>who was but a Deacon, preacheth in</hi> Samaria <hi>without the calling of the Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>yea and without their priuitie, who notwithstanding gaue their allowance to the worke.</hi> In theſe three lines are two notable falſities, not in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but in the ſubſtance of the argument. The firſt, <hi>that</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip <hi>preached without the calling of the Apostles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 6.5.</note> For he was Deacon by impoſition of the Apoſtles hands, whereby he had authority to preach, and baptiſe, which was all he did. The ſecond, <hi>that he did this without the Apostles priuity,</hi> which is not ſaid in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but added to it by <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis,</hi> who would gladly haue <hi>S. Philip</hi> like vnto their Miniſters to haue run not being ſent, <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> (if his authority be of any weight with him) ſaith expreſly, that he was ſent in theſe words.<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Iubaianum.</note> 
                  <hi>They that beleeued in</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, <hi>beleeued in true faith: and were baptized by</hi> Philip <hi>Deacon, whom the Apoſtles ſent,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His third argument is the example of <hi>Frumentius</hi> before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and retorted vpon himſelfe, as an euident argument againſt his doctrine both there and here.</p>
               <p>His fourth argument is drawne out of theſe words of <hi>Origen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hom. <hi>11.</hi> in <hi>18.</hi> numeri.</note> 
                  <hi>Et conſideremus ne fortè ſicut in aliqua (verbi gratia) ciuitate, vbi nondum Christiani nati ſunt, ſi accedat aliquis, &amp; docere incipiat, &amp; laboret, instruat, adducat ad fidem, &amp; ipſe poſtmodum ijs, quos docuit, Princeps &amp; Epiſcopus fiat: ita etiam ſancti angeli eorum, quos è diuerſis gentibus congregauerint, &amp; labore ſuo, ac miniſterio proficere fecerint, ipſi eorum etiam in futuro prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes fiant.</hi> That is: And let vs conſider whether peraduenture, as in a city where Chriſtians are not yet borne, if one come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and begin to teach, and labour, inſtruct, bring them to the faith, and afterward is made their Prince and Bishop, whom he hath taught: ſo alſo the holy Angels may be Princes of thoſe, whom by their labour they haue gathered together of diuers Nations, and whom they haue made to profit by their miniſtery. Now what argument <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis</hi> can draw out of theſe words to ſerue his purpoſe, I ſee not. For <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith nothing, but that he, that hath conuerted any city to the faith, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Bishop, which no man denieth. For <hi>S. Peter</hi> did ſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23816:40"/> in <hi>Rome, S. Denis</hi> in <hi>Paris, S. Auguſtine</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and others in other places. How doth this prooue, that the people may make their owne Bishops or Paſtors? But <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis</hi> hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth himſelfe with his accuſtomed manner of corrupting his Authors, which is ſo ordinary with him, that many authorities shalt thou not finde (good Reader) either of Scripture, or Fathers ſincerely vſed by him. And therefore, no maruell, that for ſuch falſity, he receiued that shame, and confuſion, in the preſence of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4.

With this art he helpeth himſelfe here and ſaith <hi>VVe haue example of the people, calling their Paſtors in thoſe of whom</hi> Origen <hi>ſpeaketh, that shall come by chance into a City, where neuer any Christian was borne, shall there begin to teach, to labour, to inſtruct the people in the faith, whom the people shall afterwards make their Paſtours and Bishops.</hi> Marke I pray thee (iudicious Reader) where thou findeſt in <hi>Origen</hi> theſe words: <hi>(shall come by chan e)</hi> and theſe more important <hi>(whom the people shall afterwards make their Paſtors and Bishops)</hi> and learne to know <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis</hi> his fidelity, in this point of citing Authors.</p>

For euident it is, that they haue no miniſtery ordayned by Bishops. So that it reſteth to be examined, whether ſuch as haue the ſole order of Prieſt-hood, and are not Bishops, haue power to ordaine Prieſts: or whether Prieſts,, and Bishops are of equall power and authority: Which queſtion may haue two ſenſes.<note place="margin">Two diuers meanings of the question.</note> The firſt, whether theſe functions be equall in any reſpect, the ſecond, whether they be equall in all reſpects. As concerning the firſt ſenſe, all Catholikes doe teach that Prieſts, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are equall in that, which is the prime and principall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Prieſt-hood, conſiſting in the conſecrating of the true body and bloud of Chriſt, in a true and proper ſacrifice of the new law. Which power our Sauiour gaue to his Apoſtles, (and in them to all Prieſts lawfully deſcended from them by true ordination) in his laſt ſupper when he ſaid: <hi>Hoc facite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>doe ye this.</hi> For this reaſon theſe two appellations of Bishops and Prieſts, are often taken the one for the other in this ſort, that as well in holy Scripture, as in the ancient Fathers Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are called Prieſts, and that truely, for they are ſo indeed: as iudges may truely be called Councellers: or a man may as truely be called a liuing thing, the greater or more perfection contayning the leſſe. And contrariwiſe Prieſts are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called Bishops, which doth not argue, that they were equall in all reſpects, but in ſome one, which is true, as is already noted. Now how farre or in what other reſpects, this equality is to be acknowledged, betweene Bishops and Prieſt pertayneth not to this place to examine. For ſuppoſing they be vnequall, in this one point of power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Prieſts and Paſtors; though they should be equall in all other reſpects whatſoeuer, it will be ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this queſtion, in our fauour, and againſt our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For as much therefore as concerneth the ſecond ſenſe and meaning of this queſtion, it is the vniforme doctrin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of all Catholike men in all ages, that Bishops haue this
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23816:42"/> power aboue Prieſts, that they can conſecrate or ordaine Prieſts, and Paſtors, which Prieſts cannot doe. This being proued true, it will manifeſtly appeare, that none of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of all the pretended Churches reformed, which are knowne, and confeſſed to haue receiued their ordination, and calling from Prieſts only, (as they all doe, excepting thoſe in England and in France, the latter comming from <hi>Caluin</hi> who was not ſo much as Prieſt, no nor Deacon) are lawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but meere Lay-men, and manifeſt intruders, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23816:42"/> and vnder the name, and title of Lay perſons were admitted to the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, it is a thing ſo euident to all the world, that no man doth thinke it to be doubted of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What thoſe holy Fathers, and moſt renowned Paſtors tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the whole Chriſtian world (I meane thoſe of the firſt Councell of Nice, for by them was <hi>Coluthus,</hi> and his cenſured) would haue ſaid, or done to our new Miniſters, who doe not ſo much as pretend to be ordered by Bishops, but doe confeſſe themſelues to receiue their Miniſtery, from ſuch, as were Prieſts onely, (ſo shamefully abſurd are they) what I ſay they would haue concluded againſt them, if either they had liued now, or that theſe Miniſters had liued then in their daies, I leaue euen to the partialleſt Reader to iudge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But yet more euidently is this doctrine of the equality of Prieſts and Bishops conuinced of abſurdity. For the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church aboue 1200. yeares agoe hath branded the author thereof, who was called <hi>Aerius,</hi> with the note of hereſie euen for this point.

                  <hi>His words were more furious, then humane, ſaying: what difference is there betwixt a Prieſt, and a Bishop? the one differeth nothing from the other: it is one and the ſelfe-ſame order, one and the ſame honour, one and the ſame dignity. The Bishop doth impoſe hands, and ſo doth the Prieſt, the Bishop baptiſeth, and ſo doth the Prieſt, the Bishop doth conſecrate the Miſteries of diuine worship, and ſo doth the Prieſt, the Bishop ſitteth in the throne, ſo doth the Prieſt. And with theſe words he ſeduced many, who eſteemed him as their guide.</hi> And a little after. <hi>But all this is foolish, as is manifeſt to any of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. For how is it poſſible to ſay, that the Bishop and Prieſt are equal? becauſe the Epiſcopall order is the begetter of Fathers, for as much as it beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fathers to the Church: whereas the order of Priest-hood hauing not power to beget fathers: by the lauer of regeneration doth beget children to the church, but not Fathers, and Doctors.</hi> Thus farre <hi>S.

But let vs ſee, what he bringeth for the iuſtification of this ſo long ſince condemned hereſie.</p>
               <p>His firſt argument is this. <hi>The beſt learned amongſt the Romaniſts confeſse that, that wherin a Bishops excelleth a presbyter, is not a distinct and higher order, or power of order, but a kind of dignitie, or office, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment only wich they prooue: becauſe that a Bishop ordeyned</hi> per ſaltu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>or that neuer had the ordination of a Presbyter, can neither conſecrate, nor ordayne, though a Prieſt, that neuer was Deacon, may lawfully exerciſe the office of a Deacon, becauſe the higher order includeth the lower. Hence</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it followeth that that, wherin a Bishop excelleth a Prieſt, is not a diſtinct power of order, but an eminencie yeelded to one aboue the rest of the ſame ranke for orders ſake, and to preſerue the vnitie of the church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He either doth not or will not vnderſtand, the doctrine of theſe ſchoolemen, to whoſe iudgment if he would ſtand, he could not defend <hi>Aerius</hi> his errour. For though theſe whom he citeth, with diuers others teach, that, that wherin a Bishop doth excell a Prieſt, is not a diſtinct order, or ſacrament from prieſt-hood; yet none of them all deny, but that it is either a diſtinct power of order, from that which is in a Prieſt, which power <hi>S. Thomas</hi> in the place by him cited ſaith, <hi>is a power in certaine Hierarchicall actions</hi> (meaning the power to ordaine Prieſts and other church officers) <hi>in reſpect of the miſticall body of Chriſt, aboue that which is in a Prieſt?</hi> or at leaſt the ſame power of order ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendded, not by externall deputation, but by ſacramentall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration: not by the churches ordenance but by Chriſts owne inſtitution: as <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> and <hi>Sotus.</hi> And if he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, how it may be a diſtinct power of order, and yet not a diſtinct order, let him vnderſtand that one, and the ſame order, may haue diuers powers; As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, the order of Prieſthood hath power, to conſecrate the true naturall body of our Sauiour Chriſt, and alſo to abſolue men, who are the members of his miſticall body (the church) from ſin, ſo likewiſe the ſame order of prieſthood may be extended by Epiſcopall conſecration, to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23816:44"/> haue power in ſundrie Hierarchicall actions (as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) without addition of any new order vnto it, whervnto the ſimple order of preiſthood cannot reach. And this is the cleare meaning of thoſe diuines, that hold the order of a Bishop, not to be a diſtinct order, from that of a Prieſt, which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is probable, but not certaine, (for many moſt graue and learned auctors teach the contrarie) and therfore no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground, to build ſo important a point of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion vpon, as is the true calling of Gods miniſters. Yea were it certaine, yet doth it nothing helpe his purpoſe. Becauſe a ſimple Prieſt hath not the power of order, with the ſame exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or ampliation which a Bishop hath in thoſe ſchoolemens opinions. And hence it is manifeſt againſt <hi>D. Fields</hi> illation, that in the doctrine of theſe deuines, that, wherin a Bishop doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a Prieſt, is not only <hi>an eminencie giuen to one aboue others of the ſame ranke for orders ſake,</hi> but a true power of order giuen or at leaſt extended by conſecration, wherby the order of prieſt-hood is extended to thoſe actions (to wit of ordering Prieſts, and other Eccleſiaſticall officers, wher vnto without conſecration it cannot reach. And this alſo in their opinion is the reaſon, why a Bishop that is not a Prieſt (if ſuch an one could be) can neither conſecrate the naturall body of Chriſt in the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, nor yet ordaine Eccleſiaſticall miniſters; though a Prieſt, that neuer was Deacon, may do the functions of a Deacon. For all holy order being meaſuted by the power it hath in, or about the naturall body of Chriſt in the holy Euchariſt, which power is perfected in prieſt-hood: where that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, there can be no higher order, becauſe this doth eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially preſuppoſe the other, and where that is, there are alſo all inferiour orders, becauſe theſe are referred, and ordayned to the other, and are eſſentiallie included in it.</p>

               <p>His ſecond argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may be thus framed, <hi>in caſe of neceſsitie euery ſimple presbyter may baptiſe, confirme, abſolue, and reconcile penitents, and do all thoſe other acts, which regularly are appropriated to the Bishop alone: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in caſe of neceſsitie, namely all Bishops being dead, or become heretiques, they may in like manner ordaine presbyters.</hi> I graunt that in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, a ſimple Prieſt may do all that, which is reſerued to the Bishop by Eccleſiaſticall, or poſitiue lawes.

               <p>
                  <hi>M. D. Field</hi> is either fowly ouerſeene in this anſwere, or els would wittinglie deceiue his reader therwith. For the Fathers do not make voide the ordinations of Prieſts made by Prieſts, by any poſitiue canon, as they do the ordinations he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but do declare them none, abſolutelie, and in the nature of the thing it ſelfe (to vſe his owne manner of ſpeaking). And this is cleare, firſt by the Fathers owne words: <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> ſaith expreſly, that Prieſts haue not power to beget Fathers to the church, but children only, where it is manifeſt, that he ſpeaketh of the nature of the thing, for ſuch Prieſts as are ſubiect to the canons by <hi>M. Field</hi> cited haue not power, (that is, haue not lawfull vſe of the power) to beget children to the church by Baptiſme. Farther the councell of <hi>Alexandria</hi> before cited, vrging how <hi>Iſchyras</hi> (ordained by <hi>Coluthus</hi> a true Prieſt, but a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:23816:46"/> Bishop) could be Prieſt, and by whom he was ordered? muſt needs vnderſtand, that he wanted not only lawfull ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but true and ſufficient ordination. For if he had had true ordination, and only a canonicall impediment ſuſpending the vſe therof, the <hi>Arians</hi> enemies vnto <hi>S. Athanaſius,</hi> would quickly haue abſolued him from that impediment. Againe <hi>S. Hierome</hi> and <hi>S. Chriſoſtome</hi> expreſly denying only the power of ordayning to Prieſts, cannot be vnderſtood otherwiſe, then of the nature of the thing, and not by the rigour of any canon, for in that ſort, they muſt haue denied many other things vnto them, which (by <hi>M. Fields</hi> owne confeſſion) are at leaſt for orders ſake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to Bishops. Moreouer how could <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>S. Augustin</hi> eſteeme <hi>Aerius</hi> an heretique, for teaching that Prieſts might ordaine Prieſts, if this were forbidden them by the rigour of poſitiue canon only, and not of the nature of the thing? Theſe Fathers were neither ſo ignorant, nor ſo light of iudgment to condemne one of hereſie, for contradicting a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue canon, or at leſt would they not haue omitted to ſpecifie the canon.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Secondly the Fathers declaring voide the ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s made by only Prieſts (as <hi>M. Field</hi> confeſſeth) and that not by the force of any canon, for there was no ſuch canon, (at leſt before the councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> where as we ſee by <hi>S. Athanaſius</hi> all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations made by the counterfeite Bishop <hi>Coluthus</hi> though a true Prieſt, were declared to be none) this iudgment (which by the confeſſion of our aduerſaries is of moſt weighty authoritie) muſt needs be grounded in the nature of the ordination, as not proceeding from ſufficient power, and not from any canon or conſtitution, no ſuch canon being then made. For I ſuppoſe no man wilbee ſo abſurdly impertinent, as to ſay that a precedent action auailable of it ſelfe may be anulled and made voide (for the time when it was done) by a following or latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, though there were any ſuch, which I know not, whether there be or no. And hence it is manifeſt, that <hi>M. D. Field</hi> his anſwere to the Fathers authorities, is but a meere eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or colour of an anſwere. But that all may vnderſtand the great difference betweene the Fathers declaration, of the nullitie of the ordinations made by Prieſts only: and the intent of the canons by <hi>M. Field</hi> alleaged, which make voide
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23816:47"/> future ordinations without title, and the reſt ſpecified by him.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerued, that the fathers alleaged for the former caſe, do not make any canon, or conſtitution for future actions, but giue their definitiue ſentence and iudgment of an action paſt, declaring it to be of no value, wheras the canons allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the ſecond caſe, are conſtitutions made for future facts, prohibiting the whole vſe of the orders ſo giuen, and punishing as well the giuer, as the receiuer, but not anullating the order it ſelf, (for that is not in the power of the church, as all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique men do beleeue) and in this reſpect theſe conſtitutions are like vnto thoſe ciuill lawes, that make wards or pupils, for theſe lawes do not take away from him, that is ward or pupill the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, which he hath in his inheritance, but only ſuſpend the vſe therof, during his minoritie, and therfore maketh voide all contracts, which he shall make, during that eſtate of wardship. And as he at the time prefixt by the lawe, certaine circumſtances obſerued, cometh to the full and perfect vſe of his lands, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout any new purchaſe or gift, ſo in like manner thoſe, that hauing bene debarred, or ſuſpended from the vſe of their orders receiued againſt the ordinance of the canons, hauing giuen iuſt ſatisfaction to the church for their fault committed, are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the free, and lawfull vſe of their orders, without any new ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as is manifeſt by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall practiſe of the church. So that the difference betwixt the declaring an ordination to be none, and the ſuſpending the vſe therof, is very great, as euery one may ſee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Field</hi> his ſecond anſwere, as it is but his owne aſſertion wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thot any groud either of reaſon, authority, or inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in practiſe, as hath bene hetherto shewed, is as eaſely by vs denied, and with better reaſon, then by him affirmed.</p>
               <p>He concludeth his diſcourſe with this vaine bragge. <hi>Thus then we ſee that obiection which our aduerſaries tooke to be vnanſwerable, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>What wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of modeſtie, honeſty, or iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t theſe words shew, I had rather the reader should ſee, then I should tell him. Firſt

Secondly it is as euidentlie falſe, as it is true that the ſunne is vp at noone-tide that any meddle with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing orders of Prieſt-hood, in the Roman church, but ſuch as are truely conſecrated Bishops.

This ſingle-ſoled shift is effectually refuted aboue, by authority of holy Scripture Fathers, and euident reaſon: And for the preſent I ſay, that they ſticke euer in the ſame mire. For what other proofes doe they bring, for the truth of their doctrine, which all the aforenamed heretiques did not bring. They bring Scriptures: and did not

I will diſperſe a little this miſt, that the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker eyes may ſee the ſun, and diſcerne how little it maketh for our Miniſters purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is doubtfull, whether this reuolt ſpoken of by the Apoſtles shall goe before Antichriſt, or shal follow him as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him: Secondlie, whether it shall be a temporall reuolt, or a reuolt in religion: Thirdly, if it be a reuolt in religion whether it be a reuolt only of Heretiques, and the Apoſtles meaning be, that till all the heretiques, that are to reuolt, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted, the day of our Lord shall not come; or if it be an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie of ſome part of the church, which shal renounce the name of Chriſt, and adore Antichriſt. Fourthly, whether the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here mentioned by the Apoſtle, be the temple of Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, as the conference of the 9. chapter of Daniel, the 24. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of S. Mathew, the 5. chapter of S. Iohn, and the 11. of the Apocalips doth shew it to be: or the ſocietie either whole or halfe that ſometimes bare the name of the Church, in which ſignification, the word temple without addition was neuer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before. Fiftly, whether the ſpirit of our Sauiours mouth, wherewith Antichriſt is to be deſtroyed, by the preaching of his word by the Paſtors of the church, whereby he shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried, and looſe all credit and eſtimation: or the maieſty, and glory of the ſecond comming of our Sauiour, and the ſentence which he shall pronounce againſt Antichriſt, that is, whether it be the word of doctrine, or of power and vertue, which shall deſtroy Antichriſt. All which queſtions if they be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued according to the doctrine of the ancient church, are ſo far from affording to our new Miniſters, any proofe of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary calling, to preach againſt Antichriſt, that they will prooue them to be his manifeſt fore-runners, and potent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents to prepare his way. But being reſolued howſoeuer this authoritie of the Apoſtle, cannot furnish them with any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to proue their extraordinary vocation. For if they will ſay that Antichriſt is to occupie the whole church, it will euidently follow in their doctrine, that the Pope is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, as they ſurmiſe: becauſe there are diuers Churches,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23816:57"/> which they eſteeme true churches and to haue the ſucceſſion of ordinary calling, which notwithſtanding are ſeparated in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from the church of Rome, as the Ethiopians, Grecians, Armenians, Syrians, Ruſſians, and other. So that following this doctrine, they are conuinced, that the Pope is not Antichriſt, and conſequently that they are heretiques for teaching him ſo to be. If they ſay that Antichriſt is to rule but ouer one part of the church only, the other being free from his ſubiection, what neceſſity can there be to faine an extraordinary calling of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to preach againſt him, ſeeing that part of the true church, which shall be free from his tyranie, hath meanes to furnish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors by the ordinary courſe and calling? and ſo are theſe men euidently caught in the ſnare they ſet for others.</p>

For though the particularitie, whereby euery Prophet made proofe of his extraordinary calling, be not regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the holy Scripture, as it is not neceſſary they should, yet are thoſe of the moſt and chiefeſt, which ought to be a rule of the reſt.

If they had but the leaſt of all thoſe, that haue bene done euen in our owne daies, at our ladies of <hi>Sichem,</hi> and elſwhere, in confirmation of the catholique religion, and confutation of their hereſie, what triumph would they make? But that the apperition of this ſtar is moſt idly, and impertinentlie alleaged, as a miracle proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing either their religion, or their extraordinarie calling, it is euident by theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is ſo farre from being certaine, that it was a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtarre; that is, a ſtarre produced by ſupernaturall vertue and operation, that it is ſcarſe probable. Secondlie, ſuppoſing it was a miracle, there appeareth no probable reaſon, that it had any reſpect, or relation to the pretended religion, wherby it may be thought to be an approbation therof. For neither was it fore-told, or forſeene by any of their religion: neither was it obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any of their praiers: neither was it accommodated, or applied to that end by any externall effect. How can it therfore be ſaid to haue appertained to that purpoſe? Againe it came too late to portend, or foreshew <hi>the bearing of Chriſt againe, through the preaching of his word by their firſt reformers.</hi> For <hi>Luther</hi> began his Apoſtacie, which was the beginning of their Goſpell, the yeare 1517. and this ſtarre appeared the yeare 1572. that is 55 yeares after, wheras ſignes, which foreshew any thing to come, muſt needs go before that, which they do forshew.

Becauſe that God doth not vſe to shew his diſpleaſance in any action, by making new ſtars, but by thunder, tempeſts, earthquakes, fire, and the like. Againe new ſtars are no ſignes of Gods wrath, or anger, but of his good liking, and pleaſance, as appeareth by the ſtarre, which reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

They muſt of neceſſitie allow the Pope and church of Rome, to haue a lawfull or at leaſt a ſufficient calling: (For otherwiſe it is vnpoſſible, ſo much as to imagine, that they could receiue any ſuch from it.) Seying ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their doctrine, holy order is neither a ſacrament, not leaueth in him that is ordained, any indeleble marke, character, or ſpirituall power, by vertue wherof, all ſuch actions which he doth pertayning to that order, are reall and truly ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and therfore not to be reiterated (as the catholique doctrine teacheth) but is only a meere morall deputation, of ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the function, of miniſtring the word and ſacraments, which being loſt, taken away, or ſuſpended, all power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any ſuch actions, as pertanie to that function is alſo loſt, and taken away; and conſequentlie, if ſuch an one shall attempt to exerciſe any ſuch actions, he shall do nothing, but committ ſacrilege in attempting to do a holy action, which is not in his power to performe. This doctrine of theirs admitted, how can they pretend, to receiue any calling from the Pope or Church of Rome, which (as they ſay) long ſince loſt all power, either to miniſter the ſacraments themſelues, or to ordaine others to that calling? Surely if their doctrine of the ſacrament of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and of the church of Rome her reuolt from Chriſt, should be true, it is as vnpoſſible for them to haue any true calling to the miniſterie, as it is for him to be kinght or iudge, that hath his order or office from him, that being declared rebell to his ſoueraigne, hath loſt all power of ordaining ſuch perſons, though he had it before. And therfore as he, that being made iudge by ſuch a one, should in vertue of that ordination exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe that office, should be no leſſe rebell to his ſoueraigne, then he that made him.

Shall we therfore be ſo deuoide of all ſenſe, as to thinke <hi>Luther,</hi> and his crue to be receauable for true reformers, without all proofe of his calling, and commiſſion, vpon a bare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a fayned neceſſitie? Neither is the example that <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis</hi> bringeth in their defence to any purpoſe. He ſaith thus.<note place="margin">Fol. 375.</note> 
                  <hi>A Magiſtrate called to the gouernment of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, finding the lawes corrupted by his predeceſſors, the place of iuſtice full of iniuſtice, offices ſubiect to ſale and the like, taketh
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:23816:62"/> in hand to reforme all, and to reduce it to the cenſure of the lawes. Now would he not be worthie to be laught at, that should aske him by what right or title he doth this?</hi> This example he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to agree with their firſt Paſtors, who hauing bene ordered Prieſts in the Romane Church, vſed their calling, as he pretended, to the reformation of corruptions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes crept into the Church, by the negligence and malice of their predeceſſors, and therfore cannot be rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, by what authoritie they do it. Let vs admit this example for good, and then aske of <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis,</hi> what anſwere he would giue vnto the <hi>Arians,</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> making this argument againſt the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Germany</hi> and France. I ſuppoſe he would ſay, that their pretence of reformation is but a vizard, and cloake, to enter into the Church, and afterwards to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the peace therof, and to draw men into errour. And that if euerie one pretending reformation were to be hearkened vnto, either in the eccleſiaſticall, or ciuill eſtate, it would bee vnpoſſible to keepe any peace, or order in either. This ſame anſwere will fit <hi>Monſieur du Pleſsis</hi> his example. Secondly this example maketh nothing to the purpoſe, vnles theſe two things be prooued. Firſt, that the Church may be ſo corrupt in doctrine, and manners, as that no Paſtors remaine vncorrupt to reforme it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it was in that ſtate, when <hi>Luther</hi> ran out of the Church. For vnles theſe be prooued, what appearance of probabilitie can there be in this example? But it is as poſſible to prooue theſe things, as it is to prooue the holy ſcripture to be falſe, or God to haue fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his promiſe, as hath bene shewed before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Luther</hi> and his folowers do not pretend only to reforme the corruptions which they falſly imagin to be in the Church, but they would thruſt out of office the true and lawfull Paſtors, by whom they receiued their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of prieſthood, and make themſelues the ſole rulers and gouernours, not of Gods Church, but of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of their owne gathering. Which abſurd abuſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23816:63"/> if any ſeditiouſe head should attempt in the temporall ſtate, he would quickly be recompenſed with the hier due vnto ſuch a one. This example therefore of <hi>Monſieur du Pleſſis</hi> being rightly applyed doth manifeſtly comdemne <hi>Luther</hi> and all his Seditious brood.</p>

               <p>The holy ſcripture to shew the weight and moment of this calling, doth often, and in moſt cleere tearmes declare, that our Sauiour himſelfe did not take vpon him this dignity, but by miſſion from his father, <hi>S.

But to come to the obiection it ſelf, wherin <hi>Monſi. du Pleſsis</hi> vſeth his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed falſity, adding of his owne, and inuenting the ſayings of his authors, as he thinketh moſt for his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The true ſtate of the matter, for ſo much as appertayneth to this obiection is this.</p>
               <p>The Donatiſts ſeeing themſelues not able to ſuſtaine, and make their partie good againſt the manifeſt truth forciblie vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Catholiques, ſought all occaſions poſſible, to turne the diſpute from the point in controuerſie, and to ſpend the time in impertinent demands, that ſo they might (if it were poſſible) auoide the condemning ſentence, which they ſaw would fall vpon them.</p>
               <p>The maine queſtion in controuerſie was, whether the fault or crime of <hi>Cecilianus</hi> and his collegues (ſuppoſing they were
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23816:66"/> trulie guiltie of any crime) might or ought to be ſo imputed to that church, whereof they were members, and which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with them; that it was now no more the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique church, but a falſe and corrupt congregation of bad men, and therefore might iuſtlie be ſo abandoned by the Donatiſts, that they might reiect euen the ſacrament of Baptiſme giuen in it as vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion was, whether <hi>Cecilianus</hi> and his collegues were indeed trulie guiltie of anie crime worthie of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or cenſure. That theſe were the maine queſtions in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, is euident by the mandate of the Catholiques, ſet downe in the firſt daies conference. The Catholiques maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and euidentlie proued the negatiue in both theſe queſtions,<note place="margin">Art. 54 45.</note> as appeareth in the whole conference, and alſo by the ſentence giuen accordinglie in the end of all.</p>

Auguſtine,</hi> and his Catholiqe partakers doe rightly reiect this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his ordination, as impertinent to the matter in hand. For had he beene ordered by <hi>Cecilian</hi> (as doubtleſſe diuers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Bishops were) yet before the Donatiſts could inferre any thing thereupon for their purpoſe, they were firſt to proue, that <hi>Cecilians</hi> faults were to be imputed, to the church, which communicated with him, which was the chiefe queſtion in controuerſie. Secondly, that <hi>Cecilian</hi> was truely guilty of the crimes obiected againſt him, which they were ſo farre from proouing, that the contrary was manifeſtly prooued by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique party. Who doth not therefore ſee, that the queſtion moued of <hi>S.

               <p>Now if <hi>Monſieur du Pleſſis</hi> can shew vs any ſuch impertinency, in our demands of their ordination, or vocation, we will ceaſe from moleſting them any farther in that kinde.

               <p>Secondly it is to be obſerued, that though hitherto hath bene ſufficientlie impugned the miniſterie of the pretended refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of France, and ſuch other falſly named Churches, as agree with it in the extraordinary calling of their miniſters, as that of Scotland, and Geneua, with whom aggree our Inglish puritanes yet becauſe there are other Proteſtant Churches, which chalenge to themſelues another kind of calling, then that of France: therfore to impugne directly, and effectuallie the ſame, it is neceſſarie, to enter into a particuler diſpute with

For it is not ten yeares ſince one of their Bishops, in priuate conference with others of his owne ranke, and confident freinds is knowne to haue confeſſed this. <hi>The french miniſters haue no meanes at all, to prooue their calling, and we in England can hardly proue ours.</hi> Therfore if <hi>M. Maſon</hi> performe this taſcke that he hath vndertaken, dexterouſly, he shall doubtles deſerue well of them all. And becauſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or conferring of holy orders, (wherby true, and lawfull calling is giuen) may be defectiue three manner of waies, to wit, either of the part of him that doth ordaine, or of him that is ordayned, or of the ordination it ſelfe, it belongeth to <hi>M. Maſon</hi> to prooue, or at leaſt maintaine that the ordinations of the Bishops in England, from Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> be not defectiue in any one of theſe reſpects, for if they faile in one of them, they cannot be true Bishops, and much leſſe if they faile in them all, as I thinke they wilbe found to doe. But before we enter into the particuler examination of <hi>M. Maſons</hi> doctrine in this point, I will wish thee, good Reader, to obſerue two or three things, ſuppoſing in the meane while theſe ordinations to be good, in all the three reſpects now mentioned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Firſt, that if the ordinations of our ſuppoſed English Bishops be not otherwiſe canonicall, but only by reaſon of the ſucceſſion they pretend to haue,<note place="margin">Note.</note> from Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> it muſt neceſſarilie follow, that all other pretended Churches, as that of <hi>France, Germanie, Geneua, Scotland,</hi> and the reſt that haue no ſuch ſucceſſion, haue no lawfull miniſterie. For if the ordination of our English Bishops be good, only becauſe it is deriued by ſucceſſion from <hi>Cranmer</hi> who was a true Bishop, thoſe Churches, that haue no ſuch ſucceſſion, can haue no ſuch ordination, and conſequently no lawfull miniſters or Paſtors. Whence farther it alſo followeth, that they can haue no lawfull Church, which cannot be without lawfull Paſtors, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed aſwell by Proteſtants as Catholiques. And yet farther that of all the reformed Churches, there is no one true, but only that of England, and therfore the Church of Chriſt, which should be Catholique or vniuerſall, as <hi>M. Maſon</hi> him ſelf proueth by this cleare profecie: <hi>I will giue the heathen for thin inheritance, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:23816:69"/> the vtternoſt ports of the earth for thy poſſeſsion</hi> muſt needs be drawne within the compaſſe of England, which is more ridiculouſly abſurd then the condemned doctrine of the Donatiſts, who affoorded the church a for larger compaſſe. Which abſurditie wilbe more apparent, if we conſider the ſmal number of the English themſelues, that hold the calling of their miniſters to be canonicall. For ſeparating firſt the Catholiques, who eſteeme the Proteſtants ordinations, but an apish imitation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique conſecrations, and then the <hi>Puritans, Browniſts,</hi> and the reſt that condemne the ſame as papiſticall, there will remayne no great number, to make vp the glorious kingdome of the ſonne of God, who <hi>hath the whole world giuen him by his father for his inheritance.</hi> as <hi>M.

This euident deduction cannot be poſſibly auoided, but by one of theſe two waies: to wit, either that the ordinations of the other reformed Churches, are all one with them of the Church of England; or els that there are diuers ſorts of cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ordinations of Paſtors in the Church of Chriſt. And yet both theſe are euidently falſe. For to begin with the latter, where is it read in holy ſcripture, or other authenticall record, that either our Sauiour Chriſt ordained, or his Apoſtles practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed diuers ſorts, or fashions of ordinations in his Church? Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely no where. And ſeeing this is a point of principall moment, as being the firſt thing required in the building of Gods houſe, nothing ought to be affirmed therin without euident warrant, eſpecially by our newly reformed maſters, who pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all things, to the ſquare of the written word it ſelfe. But yet we will deale more liberallie with them, then to ty them ſo ſtrictly to the ſcriptures, and wilbe content to take for good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, one only inſtance of practiſe, not with in the firſt fiue hundred yeares after Chriſt, as they exact of vs in other points, but within the whole fifteene hundred yeares, one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and approoued inſtance I ſay, of any other ſort of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Paſtors in the Church, but by the viſible and ſenſible impoſition of hands by Bishops, Which notwithſtanding they are not able to produce. Falſe therfore and abſurd it is to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that there are diuers ſorts, of ordinarie callings of Paſtors (for of ordinarie calling we ſpeake here) hauing already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently refuted all pretence of extraordinarie.</p>

                  <hi>5.</hi> Neither is the firſt euaſion (to wit that the ordinations of the church of England, and of France are all one) leſſe falſe. For where there is not one and the ſame formall cauſe, there cannot be the ſame effect: but in the ordinations of Paſtors in the English, and French Churches, there is not the ſame formall cauſe, for in the English it is the power of a Bishop (at leaſt as is pretended) which is not in the French church; therfore cannot the effect, or ordinance be all one. For to ſay that the power of Prieſts, and Bishops is all one in reſpect of ordination, is an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned 1200. yeares agoe in <hi>Aerius,</hi> as is already shewed. And though ſome of our new maſters would inferre,<note place="margin">Doct. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and D. Field.</note> that Prieſts haue the ſame power to ordaine, that Bishops haue, vpon the opinion of ſome ſchoolemen, teaching that the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Prieſts, and Bishops are all one: yet are they euidently conuinced, either not to vnderſtand the ſchoolemen, or guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to diſſemble their doctrine. For thoſe ſchoolemen that teach, that the character of prieſthood, and Bishophood to be all one, do alſo teach, that the ſame character is extended in Bishops, by their conſecrations to certaine actions, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely to the giving of prieſthood, wherunto it is not extended in Preiſts, and this not by any poſitiue decree, or ordinance of the church, but by Chriſts owne inſtitution. Wherfore it is moſt manifeſt, that if the whole doctrine of theſe ſchoolemen be expreſſed, (as it muſt be, if any one will inferre any thing of their opinion) it maketh directly againſt this hereſie, of the equalitie of Prieſts and Bishops, in reſpect of ordination of Paſtors: but of this matter is ſpoken largly aboue cap. 7. n. 6.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Againe though this equalitie of Prieſts and Bishops were (againſt the truth) graunted, yet would it nothing helpe them in the queſtion now in hand, to wit, whether the ordinations of the English, and French Churches be all one: it being cleare, that the French Churches do not receiue, or admit of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations made by Prieſts; but if any Prieſts run out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church to them, they ordeyne them a new (if they thinke them worthie of their miniſterie) ſo farre are they from receiuing ordinations made by Preiſts. For which reaſon doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles do our English Puritans eſteeme ſo vily of ordinations made by Bishops, as we shall by and by heare out of <hi>M. VVhitaker</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:23816:70"/> and <hi>M. Fulke.</hi> Yea <hi>Caluin</hi> the firſt founder of the French Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (and therfore are they not very ancient) was himſelfe no Prieſt, yet did he ordaine miniſters, not in vertue of any prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood (which he had not, and which his ſchollers blaſphemouſly tearme the marke of the beaſt,) but as hauing power, not only to preach, but alſo to ordaine miniſters immediatlie from God, and not by any ſucceſſion of ordination deriued vnto him, by the impoſition of hands of prieſthood.</p>
               <p>From all which I conclude thus. The Church of England hath a different ordination of Paſtors, from the churches of France, and all other churches, that haue not their miniſters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned by Bishops: therfore hath it alſo a different miniſterie: of a different miniſterie followeth neceſſarilie a different Church (which is nothing but the people vnited with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tium.</note> as <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> defineth it) but of two different Churches, the one at leaſt muſt needs be the Synagogue of <hi>Satan,</hi> (for Chriſt hath but one Church) I ſay at leaſt one; for they may well be both ſo: truth in euerie thing being but one, wheras falſitie mey be infinite. Whence <hi>M. Maſon</hi> may ſee how ill he deſerueth his name: For labouring to make vp the breach in their church, by proouing the calling of their Bishops by ſucceſſion from the church of Rome, he hath made it much greater, by ſeparating their Church from all their hitherto pretended ſiſter Churches, and therby making it to ſtand alone, without communion with any other Church in the whole world (the euident brand of a ſchiſmaticall conuenticle.) For the communion, which is required to the vnitie of the church, is not the ſole agreement in ſome points of Chriſtian beliefe, for ſo all Chriſtians, be they <hi>Anabaptiſts, Arrians,</hi> or other heretiques whatſoeuer, should be all of one Church (which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no man of common ſenſe will ſay,) but the agreement muſt be in all points of faith, and principallie in the lawfull calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitution of Paſtors, which is as it were the roote, and foundation of all communion, <hi>S.

               <p>Secondly it is to be obſerued, that thoſe that hold the Pope to be that ſpeciall Antichriſt foretold in the holy ſcriptures, and therfore beleeue the Bishops of the Romane Church,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23816:70"/> to be promoters for Antichriſt, and not Paſtors of Chriſts flocke, muſt neceſſarilie alſo hold, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> ordained by them was no lawfull Bishop. For that great Antichriſt being by the vniforme conſent of all Chriſtians, the moſt oppoſite enemie of Chriſt that can be imagined,<note place="margin">Du Pleſſis and the French mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned aboue grownd their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here vpon.</note> it cannot enter into any ſenſible mans vnderſtanding, that he can or will miniſter any power ſo neceſſarie, and ſo directlie ſeruing for the glorie of Chriſt, as the true ordination of Paſtors doth. And much leſſe can it be imagined, that our Sauiour Chriſt, the wiſdome of his Father, should leaue the power of ordayning neceſſarie Paſtors of his flocke (ſo dearelie purchaſed by him) in the hands of his enemie in ſuch ſort, as the true miniſters of his Goſpell should be forced to go to him, or his proctors, for their warrant and commiſſion to preach his truth, and miniſter his ſacraments to the people redeemed with his moſt pretious bloud. What calling therfore could <hi>Cranmer</hi> receiue of the Bishops of the Romane Church, in the opinion of theſe men, who notwithſtanding thinke themſelues to haue the ſpirit of God? Surely no true calling, or commiſſion to preach the Goſpell of Chriſt, and miniſter his ſacraments, but rather the marke of the beaſt to deſtroy his Church and kingdome.</p>
               <p>And for this reaſon, do the Churches of the pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in France, and elſwhere, abſolutely diſclaime from all calling, receiued from the Bishops of the Romane Church: deriuing their vocation from themſelues, without all ſucceſſion to any predeceſſors, conformable to the reſt of their doctrine: The <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> in France in the profeſſion of their faith,<note place="margin">Confeſſ. artic. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which ſecond reſolution if we follow, (as it is the doctrine of the farre greater part of the Churches falſly called reformed) euerie one ſeeth, how litle it auaileth to lawfull calling, to haue bene ordered by the Bishops of the Romane Church, and to be deſcinded by ſucceſſion from them.

But let them diſpute thereupon one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till they either driue out all light of reaſon from both their vnderſtandings, and ſo become blinde Atheiſts, towards which downefall they are farre ſlidden already, or elſe till they haue vomited out all their malice, againſt the Catholique Church, whereby they are become ſo blind, as they can neither ſee the <hi>cleare burning lampe ſet vpon the candle-ſticke,</hi> nor <hi>the city mounted vpon the height of hils.</hi> Let them I ſay diſpute together vpon this point of their calling, or manner of deriuing it from the Apoſtles, to themſelues, whileſt I touch a little nearer <hi>M.

               <p n="9">9. It is thirdly to be obſerued, that <hi>M.

                  </note> and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that all heretiques are Antichriſts, and conſequently, the Bishops of the Roman churches communicating with the Pope to be alſo heretiques, cannot with any probability hold, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> receiuing his calling and ordination from them, could by vertue thereof be a lawfull Bishop. Which that it may appeare euidently to euery one: It is to be vnderſtood, that for the giuing of lawfull calling or ordination, two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in him that doth ordaine (omitting for the preſent that, which is required in him that is ordayned, and in the ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf) The one is the ſacramentall power of Epiſcopall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which in the true and Catholique doctrine, is an indeleble and incorruptible character, and marke imprinted in his ſoule, when he was ordayned. by vertue of the like character in his ſoule, that did ordayne him: The other is the lawfull authority, to vſe and exerciſe the ſame power of orders. So that without theſe two things, no man can giue to another lawfull calling or ordination. Yet is there a great difference betwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne them. For the firſt is ſo abſolutly neceſſary, that vnleſſe the ordayner haue it, he giueth nothing at all to him, whom he should ordaine,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23816:72"/> who therefore remayneth ſtill a meere Lay-man, as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: both of them committing ſacriledge, by their preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous attempt in that behalfe. The ſecond is not neceſſary, that the ordained may receiue the character, or ſacramentall, power of order, but only that he may together with the order, receiue the lawfull vſe and exerciſe thereof, ſo that hee that should be ordayned by one that wanteth the firſt, muſt be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned againe, ere he can be Prieſt or Bishop, whereas being ordayned by one wanting only the ſecond, is not to be reorday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but only to receiue that he wanteth, which is the lawfull exerciſe of the order receiued.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Let not (iudicious Reader) theſe words <hi>charecter</hi> or <hi>Sacramentall power</hi> breed any ſcruple in thee, as though the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine here deliuered were ſo builded thereupon, as without them it could not ſtand. For though it be true, that holy order is a ſacrament, and that alſo it leaueth in the ſoule of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned an indeleble character, yet doth not this otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the queſtion here in hand, then only to shew, that a certaine power is required in him, that ordayneth another in the degree of Prieſt or Bishop, without which the orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned should receiue nothing (which power whether it be a ſacrament, or leaue in the ordayned any character, or no, importeth nothing to this preſent queſtion.) And this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is neceſſarily receiued of all parts. For it is vnpoſſible, that one should receiue any thing of another, vnleſſe the other haue power to giue it. Yea the Catholique doctrine teaching an indeleble character, giuen in Holie Orders, doth much more aduantage my aduerſarie, in the queſtion now in hand, then doth the contrary, as will appeare by and by.</p>
               <p>For if we should ſuppoſe with the Proteſtants, that holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der leaueth no permanent power in him that is ordayned, by vertue whereof, the actions which he doth in his function, are made of more force and valour, then the ſame actions done by one, that neuer was ordered, it is vnpoſible to conceiue, how an hereticall Bishop should giue lawfull calling becauſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this doctrine, he himſelfe can haue no more authority to ordayne another, then he that neuer was ordayned at all. But of this we shall haue occaſion to ſpeake more hereafter. In
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23816:72"/> the meane while for the more aduantage of mine aduerſarie, I will ſuppoſe the Catholique doctrine in this point. And ſay notwithſtanding that <hi>M. Maſon</hi> holding the Pope, and all the Bishops of the Roman Church to be heretiques, cannot with any probability hold the ordination, and calling of <hi>Cranmer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from them, to be good or canonicall.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For though he receiued of them the epiſcopall character neceſſarily required to lawfull calling, yet if his ordayners were heretiques (as in <hi>Maſter Maſons</hi> opinion they were) he could not receiue of them, the lawfull vſe of the ſame chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and Epiſcopal power (they themſelues not hauing it) which notwithſtanding is alſo neceſſary to lawfull calling, as is already ſaid. This will neceſſarily follow in Maſter <hi>Maſons</hi> doctrine, vpon the proofe of theſe two points. Firſt, that to the deliuery of lawfull calling, is required in him that ordayneth, not only the power of order, but alſo the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe and exerciſe thereof. Secondly, that the lawfull vſe and exerciſe of this power is loſt, or taken away by hereſie. Theſe two things being prooued, it will neceſſarily follow I ſay that <hi>Cranmer</hi> had no lawfull calling in Maſter <hi>Maſons</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who eſteemeth the Pope, and all the Bishops of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man church to be heretiques.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The firſt of theſe two points is prooued, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Sauiour himſelfe, who gaue his Apoſtles the power of order, before hee gaue them authority to vſe it which doth shew, that theſe two powers are diſtinct the one from the other, and alſo that they are both neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to lawfull calling. At his laſt ſupper hee gaue them power, to celebrate the holy miſteries (I doe not ſay to ſacrifice his true bodie, though this alſo be true, becauſe I will not heere inuolue that controuerſie being not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to this queſtion) ſaying:<note place="margin">Luc. 22.19.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Marc. 16.15.</note> Hereby it is euident, that the power of order, and the power of the lawfull vſe thereof, which vſually is called the power of iuriſdiction, are two diſtinct things, in ſuch ſort, as that the firſt may be without the latter, which is alſo proued by the expoſtulation which the diſciples had with <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 11.3.</note> for preaching and baptizing the Gentils; which (till they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by him the warrant he had from God) they thought he had no commiſſion to doe, though they well knew his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleship.</p>
               <p>The ſame verity is alſo confirmed by the commiſſion, which the Apoſtles had to preach amongſt the Iewes before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Paſſion,<note place="margin">Math. 10.5.6.7. Marc. 6.7.8. Luc. 9.1.</note> and prohibition to preach to others, shewing that albeit the power of order be alwaies one and the ſame, yet the lawfull vſe thereof, and power of iuriſdiction may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned, or amplified, ſuſpended or quite taken away, as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him. that is the author thereof.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The example that may be taken from ciuill gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth make this yet more plaine. For the King when he maketh Magiſtrates and Officers of the Kingdome, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample Iudges, he giueth them his letters patents, whereby they are created iudges. Yet for all that can they not vſe, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this office ouer the Kings ſubiects, without a ſpeciall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or commiſſion enabling them thereunto. Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion if either it expire, or be taken from them, or be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they may ſtill remaine iudges hauing their patent, but they cannot vſe or exerciſe the office. And for this reaſon both the power of order, which is giuen by conſecration, or ordination, and the indicatory power giuen by patent, may fitly be called after the fashion of Schoole-men, <hi>potestas in actu primo</hi> (that is) a power fit or able (when the vſe and exerciſe thereof is granted) to doe ſuch and ſuch actions, and not otherwaies. Nature alſo it ſelfe affordeth examples explayning this truth. For though the fire haue power and actiuity to heat, yea and burne, yet can it doe neither vnleſſe it be applied to that, which it should heat or burne.</p>
               <p>From all which it is euidentlie concluded, that the ſole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:23816:73"/> of order in any Bishop, without the lawfull authority to vſe it, is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to giue lawfull calling. And therfore though it be confeſſe, that the ordainers of <hi>Cranmer</hi> had the true power of order, yet is not that ſufficient to prooue, that they gaue him lawfull calling, which without the lawfull power to vſe their orders, they could not giue. Wherfore it now remaineth, that we examine the ſecond point propoſed, whether the orderers of <hi>Cranmer</hi> had togither with the power of order the lawfull vſe thereof. And certaine it is, that in <hi>M. Maſons</hi> opinion they had it not. For in his opinion they were heretiques, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie had loſt all power of iuriſdiction, and lawfull vſe of their orders, as is plainly the doctrine and practiſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church aboue 1200. yeares agone, as appeareth by moſt irreproouable teſtimonies.</p>

                  <hi>If they be heretiques, they cannot be Chriſtians, if not Chriſtians, they can haue no right to the ſcriptures of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:</hi> the ſame may be ſaid of the power to ordaine others in the Church. So that by the iudgment of the auncient Church, of <hi>S. Paul</hi> yea and our Sauiour him ſelfe it is euident, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques can haue no lawfull power, to ordaine miniſters of Chriſts word and ſacraments. Whence is neceſſarilie deduced, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> in <hi>M. Maſons</hi> doctrine could be no lawfull Bishop or miniſter, becauſe he was ordained by none, but ſuch as he eſteemeth heretiques. When <hi>M. Maſon</hi> shall plaſter vp this brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che (ſtanding in his owne doctrine) I shall eſteeme him a maſter in his art and that he daubeth clenly in deed.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But <hi>M. Maſon</hi> hath yet one shift more, before he receiue the checke mate. For he will ſay, that albeit <hi>Cranmer</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned by Bishops of the Romane Church, who, as he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, were heretiques, and therfore could not receiue any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power, to deriue his orders or calling vnto others, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie shewed; yet hauing by their ordination receiued the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of order, as before is confeſſed; he might without any great difficultie recouer alſo the lawfull power, to vſe the ſame, by being admitted to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of other Bishops lawfullie ordained, as is manifeſt by the practiſe of the Church, both auncient and moderne in abſoluing from excommunication, and reconciling to the vnitie of the Church, ſuch as were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excommunicate and ſeperated from the ſame. But this shift doth not auoide, the concluſion made againſt him. For firſt this euaſion in <hi>M. Maſons</hi> doctrine, who admitteth no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter left in the ſoule of him that is ordained, (for example in him that ordained <hi>M. Cranmer</hi>) hath no shew of probabilitie at all. For if the ordination once paſt, nothing do remaine in the ordained, if by excommunication he looſe the right and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which he receiued, how can it be imagined, that he may receiue the ſame power without a new ordination? But as I ſaid before, I will giue <hi>M. Maſon</hi> leaue to helpe himſelfe out of this mire, by the hold he may take of the Catholique doctrine in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:23816:74"/> this point. In which it is nothing hard to conceiue, how a Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op, or Prieſt excommunicate, may be reſtored to his former orders, or rather to the lawfull vſe of them, without any newe ordination. The Catholique doctrine teacheth, that holy order leaueth an incorruptible marke in the ordayned, which remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the power of order doth euer remaine, and therfore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appertaining to that function can be wanting in him, but only the right, auctoritie and power lawfullie to vſe it, which may eaſily be recouered without any reordination, by the ſole remouall of the impediment, wherby he is hindered from the communion of the Church. But all this helpeth nothing <hi>M. Maſon,</hi> ſo deſperate is his caſe. For <hi>Cranmer</hi> wanting true calling, by reaſon of that defect of hereſie found in his ordainers (as <hi>M. Maſon</hi> will) it is vnpoſſible for him to find a ſuplie of this defect, and therfore muſt he neceſſarilie remaine, without true calling for euer. And the reaſon hereof is euident, becauſe this defect cannot be taken awaie, but by the reunion, and reconciliation of <hi>Cranmer</hi> to the body of the true Church, and the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Bishops. But this was abſolutelie vnpoſſible, becauſe beſides the Church of Rome, and the Catholique Romane Bishops, there were none in the whole world, of whom he could receiue this reconciliation. For to ſay, that there were other Proteſtant Churches alreadie founded before <hi>Cranmers</hi> reuoult, to which he might be reunited and reconciled, is too too idle to be alleaged, the caſe of thoſe Churches being the ſame with that of England, and worſe, as is before shewed: wherfore to recurre vnto them for helpe in this point, is like as if a lame cripple should craue help ouer a ſtile, of another that is both blind, and lame. There were indeed other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſeparated from that of Rome, long before <hi>Luthers</hi> apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie, as that of the <hi>Ethiopians, Grecians, Ruſsians,</hi> and others; but to none of all theſe did our new reformers vnite themſelues, differing as farre from them, as they do from the Catholique Romane: and therfore doth there remaine no meane of their reconciliation to any church, wherby they might recouer that, which they wanted of lawfull calling.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Hauing thus euidentlie shewed (as I thinke) that albeit it should be graunted, that our now English ſuperintendents haue their calling from the Catholique Bishops, that went
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:23816:75"/> before them, yet they cannot in their owne doctrine be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue true calling. And farther though they should be graunted to haue true calling, by reaſon of their pretended ſucceſſion, yet would this rather deſtroy, then edifie their Church, becauſe it doth euidentlie ſeparate them from all other Churches, and therfore doth conſtitute them, a manifeſt ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall conuenticle, and depriueth them of all appearance of a true Church: hauing, I ſay, ſufficientlie shewed this, I would here make an end of my diſpute with <hi>Monſieur Maſon,</hi> as hauing alreadie fruſtrated the whole drift of his booke (which is to make good their vocation, and therby to cleare their Church, from a principall defect euer obiected againſt it) were it not, that he, to wind himſelfe out of the difficultie laſt mentioned, laboureth to shew, how their calling may be good and canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, though it be deriued from that of the Romane Church, which in his opinion is Antichriſtian, and wicked, and therby prouoketh me to proceed yet farther with him, in this ſame argument.

Firſt, it is euident by the conſent of all men, that an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or proofe drawn from a ſimile, or compariſon (as this of the compoſition of the Roman Prieſt-hood is) is the moſt weake, and feeble kind of argument of all other. Secondlie, a ſimile drawne from, a naturall thing may ſomtimes, when it is fitlie applied, helpe vs to conceiue ſupernatural, which for the height, and eminencie it hath aboue our capacitie, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be conceiued of vs, but in that caſe, a ſimile prooueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. Thirdlie, all ſimiles (that they may be of any vſe in our diſcourſes) muſt be taken from things either trulie being, or at leaſt in poſſibilitie by nature to be. For he that would prooue one thing, by a ſimile taken from another, which is vnpoſſible, shall not onlie not proue that he would, but shall euidentlie diſproue the ſame. For example, if one would proue you <hi>Orthodox</hi> to be ſo compoſed, as that you should be halfe a man, and halfe an aſſe.

Againe, you know, as I ſuppoſe, that euery addition made to the eſſence, or nature of any thing doth change it into another eſſence, or nature, as euerie addition put to a number, maketh it a diſtinct number fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it was before, for the nature or eſſence of euerie thing, in good Philoſophie is like a number, which conſiſting indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, is altered by euerie addition put thereunto. The Papiſts therfore adding (as you ſay) to the nature, and eſſence of the forme of holie orders, that which appertayneth not thereunto, but maketh it idolatrous, they muſt needes corrupt the whole, and make all nettle, and conſequently leaue no roſe, for your Superintendents to plucke after them: who therefore muſt of neceſſity ſeeke their calling, elſe-where, then from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,

For as the ſoule of man is but one indiuiſible ſubſtance, hauing diuers diſtinct powers; ſo likewiſe the order of prieſthood is but one indiuiſible power, reſiding in the ſoule of the ordained, and hauing alſo diuers diſtinct fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. And therfore your conceite of two parts of their preiſthood, is but a groſſe errour of your owne, which you ſeeme to correct in the words following, calling that a function (like a ſcholler) which before you called a part, like a man igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in his tearmes. Now ſeing the whole force of your ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the obiection made, dependeth vpon this errour of two partes in the Popish prieſthood, you cannot be ſo blind but ſee, that it is nothing to the purpoſe. For if it be but one ſimple power with diuers faculties, but without parts, you muſt either take it all, and be ſacrilegious with the Papiſts, or leaue it all, and be but meere laie men. And albeit the diuers faculties, or functions of Preiſthood be giuen at diuers times, and by diuerſe words, as you ſay, yet is not preiſthood therby prooued to haue diuers parts, more then the ſoule of man is prooued, to bee alſo compounded of diuers parts, by that it firſt giueth life and growth, then ſence, and laſt of all vnderſtanding, and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Of the cheefe function of prieſthood, which is to ofter ſacrifice for the quicke and the dead, we shall haue fitter opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to ſpeake heerafter. In the meane while, I cannot omit to tell you <hi>Orthodox,</hi> that I much marueile at your rachnes in affirming, without all teſtimonie either of ſcripture, or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, that the power of ſacrificing is the miniſterie of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, eſpeciallie ſeing you are accuſtomed to demaund of your aduerſaries ſo rigorouſlie expreſſe ſcripture, for the proofe of their religion, and hold it as an article of your beleefe, that nothing is to be beleeued, which is not prooued by ſcripture. Surelie <hi>Orthodox,</hi> there is no equall dealing in this courſe of yours, and therfore for your credit ſake do I require ſome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of ſcripture, or at leaſt of antiquitie, proouing this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of yours: to wit, that the power of ſacrificing maketh the Prieſts of the Romane church, to be the miniſters of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:23816:78"/> For if this power be not diſprooued, your miniſterie, which wanteth it, is clearelie diſprooued: and ſeing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of it belongeth vnto you, as neceſſarie for the iuſtifying of your miniſterie, you foullie forget your ſelfe, in leauing it without all other proofe, but your owne bare aſſertion.</p>
               <p>For your doctrine of the latter part of their prieſthood (I ſpeake in your owne tearmes <hi>Orthodox,</hi> for your better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) thoſe, that you call Papiſts in England, are greatlie beholding to you: for you deliuer them from the fowle impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of treaſon, wherof diuers haue bene accuſed, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and executed for reconciling men to god, by the power of reconciliation, giuen them by Chriſt himſelfe, as you confeſſe. Surelie if in the Popish prieſthood (as you tearme it) be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the lawfull power of reconciliation, as you ſay, and your aduerſaries do not deny, the ſtatute made againſt the practiſe of that power, in the 23. yeare of <hi>Q.

And if for feare of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the ſeuere penaltie of the ſame ſtatute, you will ſay, that they abuſe the lawfull power of reconciliation, and therfore are, or may be traitors. I anſwere in their behalfe, that if by abuſe you vnderſtand, that they vſe it not, but by the meanes of ſacramentall confeſſion, I acknowledge that they vſe it not otherwaies, but I deny this to be any abuſe. Againe though it were an abuſe, yet can it haue no appearance of treaſon, But I ſee you readie to replie, that they reconcile men to the church, and to the obedience of the ſee of Rome, which is treaſon; wherunto I am as readie to anſwere, that their intent, and practice is only, to reconcile ſinners to God, through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their ſins by that power, which you confeſſe them to haue, and if it follow hereupon, that they are reconciled to the Catholique Romane church, as to the ſpouſe of Chriſt, who ordained this power of reconciliation, and therby are made sheepe of that fold, wherof the Pope (being Chriſts vicar vpon earth) is cheefe Paſtor, this cannot iuſtlie be imputed vnto them for treaſon, no more then it can be to you, to haue baptiſed one, wherupon followeth neceſſarilie the ſelfe ſame reconciliation to the Catholique church, and to the viſible Paſtor therof.</p>

For whileſt you ſay, that your fathers erred, you teach your ſucceſſours and scholers to ſay the ſame of you, and theirs of them, till you end in plaine Atheiſme. In one word if you will ſay any thing to the purpoſe, in the matter you haue in hand, you muſt firſt prooue by holie Scripture, the Roman Prieſt hood to be ſacrilegious, or at leaſt you muſt shew when, and by whom it began to be corrupted, ſeeing you confeſſe it was once pure and good, and then are you to prooue, that it is alſo diuiſible in ſuch ſort, as that one part or peece remaineth good, though the other be corrupted, and laſtly that you haue the ſecond part. Theſe three things when you haue well proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (as I know you can neuer prooue one of them) then may you bragge, that your calling and miniſtery is lawfull, though it be taken from that of the Roman church, which you eſteeme vnlawfull, till then your Superintendents muſt be content, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Popish Prieſts, from whom you pretend they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, (but this they neither are, nor would be) or elſe to be ſacrilegious vſurpers of an holy vocation, which though they would not be, yet are they: for true Bishops, which they would be, they are not, as henceforth shall be proued.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hitherto hath it beene prooued againſt Maſter <hi>Maſon,</hi> that though the pretended Bishop of England did truly, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie receiue their calling, from the Catholique Bishops, yet can this be none at all according to their owne doctrine, in which the Bishops of the Roman church are heretiques and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently vnable to giue any lawfull calling, as is before she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that though the former impediment were not, yet, ſeeing they diſclaime from the whole, and perfect order of the Catholique Roman Bishops, as being ſacrilegious and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, they are for another reaſon concluded to haue none at all. For the order of the Roman Prieſt-hood is not diuiſible in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts, but is one and an indiuiſible power, hauing diuers functions not vnlike our ſoules, as is before shewed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is either all whollie giuen, or nothing at all.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:23816:80"/> of the Proteſtants, that being forced to challenge their calling from thoſe, who, if they were ſuch, as by them they are eſteemed, can giue them none, are therefore conſtrayned eyther to condemne themſelues, of ſacrilegious vſurpation, and intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as hauing no calling, or to iuſtifie them whom they blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie abhorre, as wicked, and abominable.</p>
               <p>Henceforth we will examine the calling that our English in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents pretend to haue, according to the three heads before mentioned. To wit, whether their calling, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to receiue from <hi>Cranmer,</hi> be good and canonicall, as well in reſpect of the callers as of the called, and calling it ſelfe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing (as confeſſed of either part) the calling of the Catholique Roman Bishops to be good, and canonicall, or at leaſt ſo ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, as lawfull calling may be deriued from it.</p>
               <p>And becauſe there are foure diuers ſorts or degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, all pretending to be true bishops, of whoſe true calling, there is queſtion for diuers difficulties therein appearing, they shall be examined all apart, as they alſo are by M. <hi>Maſons,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firſt with <hi>Cranmer,</hi> proceeding afterward to <hi>Barlow, Scorie, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerdall</hi> and others made in King Edwards daies then deſcending to <hi>Mathew Parker</hi> with his fellowes, made in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, and laſt of all to thoſe that haue euer ſince ſucceeded vntill this day.

He that hath the kings patent of cheefe iuſticeship, is trulie cheefe iuſtice, yet if the king ſuſpend him from the execution of his office, either in whole or in part, he hath not the lawfull vſe therof:<note place="margin">The diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the lawfull vſe therof M.

For I would know of them, whether they thinke, that the <hi>Arrians</hi> had either true calling themſelues being in hereſie, or true power to call others? and whether by their ordinations, they did giue true calling to the ordained? If they ſay yea, then muſt they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie condemne the whole Catholique church of errour, and iniuſtice, for condemning them in the councell of Sardis, euen now cited and declaring them to be no Bishops. If they ſay no (as I thinke they will) then muſt they neceſſarilie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that beſides the power of order which they had, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie alſo the vnion with the Catholique church, that they might either haue true calling themſelues, or deliuer it to others, no other reaſon why they should not haue true calling, being to be aſſigned. If therfore it be prooued, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> was an heretique, and therbie ſeparated from the vnion of the Catholique church, it will alſo follow, that notwithſtanding he was canonicallie ordained (as all or moſt of the firſt <hi>Arrian</hi> Bishops were) that he loſt the lawfull vſe of his orders, and therfore neither continued in true calling himſelfe, nor could trulie call others.</p>
               <p>And to make it yet more plaine, that the actuall vnion, or communion with the bodie of Chriſt (which is his church) is neceſſarie, that any one may haue, or giue true calling (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie that no heretiques can either haue it, or giue it, they being by the Apoſtles owne mouth ſeparated from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie of the faithfull) it is to be conſidered,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10.</note> that no man is either called himſelfe, or calleth others to any Eccleſiaſticall function or office, to exerciſe the ſame in his owne name; by his owne power, or to his owne behalfe, or benefit alone: but in the power and honour firſt of Chriſt, and then in the name, and for the benefit of his church, whoſe miniſter he is; if therfore he be wilfullie ſeperated from Chriſt, and his church (as all heretiques are) he cannot do any thing in their name or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:23816:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> power, or in their honour or edification, for neither hath he their concurrence or commiſſion, being ſeparated from them, nor hath he the will and intention thervnto, but to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: Whatſoeuer therfore he doth or attempteth to do in that kind, he doth it in his owne name and power, and to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of that bodie, wherof he is either head, or member, to wit, of that ſect of hereſie, wherof he maketh profeſſion, and conſequentlie vnlawfullie. And in ſteed of making him, whom he ordaineth, a miniſter of Chriſt, and of his church, he maketh him partaker of his owne hereſie, and rebellion, and a miniſter therof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And in this reſpect there is a great difference, betweene the ſacrament of baptiſme, and holie order, though in ſome other things they be like. For though the power of order, or character be trulie giuen by heretiques (ſuppoſing alwaies the true matter and forme be vſed by a true Bishop) as is that of baptiſme; yet becauſe the power of order is an actiue power, ordained to miniſter other ſacraments, and exerciſe other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the church, wheras the character of baptiſme is onlie a paſſiue power, in reſpect of other ſacraments, which it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs capable to receiue, but not to miniſter: therfore doth the ſacrament of orders to the lawfull miniſtring therof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire beſides the power of order, the lawfull vſe of the ſame, which thoſe, who are excommunicate, and ſeparated from the vnitie of Gods church (as all heretiques are) cannot haue. And thus farre haue we prooued, that heretique Bishops, though canonicallie ordered, haue no lawfull power to vſe their epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall order, and conſequentlie cannot giue anie lawfull calling to tothers, which was the firſt of the premiſes of that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherwith our concluſion was prooued. Now it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to prooue the ſecond, which is, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> before he died, fell into hereſie.</p>
               <p>Though I neede not ſtand much vpon the proofe of this, but might make good the concluſion before ſet downe by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Either <hi>Cranmer,</hi> after his reuolt from the Catholicke church or thoſe that ordered him, were heretiques: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he or they were ſo, he could not haue the lawfull vſe, and exerciſe of his Bishops power, or order; therfore <hi>Cranmer,</hi> whether he was heretique or no, could not haue the lawfull

This argument, ſuppoſing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of all antiquitie to be true (that heretiques are not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Bishops) is vnanſwerable. And though, I ſay, I might make vſe therof, to prooue mine intent without any Farther labour, yet will I for thy greater contentment (good reader) prooue <hi>M.

               <p>If we showld now pay him with his owne coine, howe cowld he poſſibly iuſtify theyr newe ordinations? by no means can he doe it. But as in other points hertofore, we haue dealt liberallie with M.

               <p>If therfore he ſay, that he meaneth by <hi>eccleſiaſticall manner</hi> that, which hath bene vſed in the church from the beginning, and is brought downe from the Apoſtles to vs, by a nott interrupted tradition; his meaning is good, and ſuch as it should be in this point. But it is ſo euident, that their manner of making Bishops, and prieſts is ſo different, from the eccleſiaſticall manner accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this meaning that I much maruell at M.

               <p>Secondlie the words of the ſtatute before rehearſed, if he had not ouer looked them, would eaſilie haue inſtructed him in this his demaund. For if the new church hatched in king Edwards time, had approoued the eccleſiaſticall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of making Bishops and prieſts, it had bene needles, and verie ſuperfluous, to haue

If he meane the ceremonie of impoſition of hands, he ſlaundreth King Edward: If he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne their bleſsings, offerings, and croſiers; the grauitie of that ſacred action may well ſpare them: as for the ſolemne vnction, your ſelues confeſſe it to be accidentall, other of your ceremonies being partlie ſuperfluous, partlie ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious: the wiſdome of our church hath diſcretlie and religiouſlie pared them away, establishing</hi> (marke this) <hi>ſuch a forme, as is holie and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Gods ſight.</hi>

               <p>Sanders doth not ſpeake of taking awaie anie ceremonies, but ſaith directlie, that altogether a new forme of ordering was preſcribed by parlement, in King Edwards daies, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be true by the ſame forme yet obſerued, as M.

But why doth he not here ſet downe, by what authoritie the wiſdome of their church doth shaue, and pare awaie ſuch large portions of thoſe holie rites, which the wiſdome of the vniuerſall church of Chriſt hath ſo long obſerued, that the beginning therof cannot be found, and in their ſteede hath eſtabliſhed a new forme of their owne inuention, that is not ſo old as themſelues, and they

               <p>M.

But he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prooueth that theſe two things here mentoined belong to the eſſentiall matter, and forme of Epiſcopall order, nor yet that nothing els belongeth therunto. And yet the veritie of both theſe points doth ſo much import, to the triall of the queſtion in hand, that if either of them should be found falſe, our English ſuperintendents will euidentlie be prooued no lawfull Bishops, and conſequentlie M.

               <p n="1">1. FOr the more eaſie explication of this queſtion, it is firſt to be obſerued, that the preciſe matter and forme of no one Sacrament is ſo clearlie expreſſed in holie ſcripture, but that without the authoritie of the church, and tradition, there maie be doubt, and queſtion made therof. This is euident euen in Baptiſme it ſelfe. For this forme <hi>N. I baptiſe thee in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holie ghoſt</hi> which is vſed in all the weſt church: Or this forme, <hi>Be the ſeruant of Chriſt baptized in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holie ghoſt,</hi> which is vſed in the eaſt church, is no where in theſe tearmes expreſſed in the holie ſcripture. The ſame I ſaie of the matter, which all men hold to be elementall, or naturall water, and no other, which notwithſtanding is no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſlie preſcribed in holie ſcripture. The preciſe matter and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me likewiſe of the holy Euchariſt, are not ſo expresſly ſett down in holy ſcripture but (were it not fore the churches auctoritie) there might, as alſo there haue beene queſtions therof. And here by the way it may be noted, how neceſſarie the authoritie of the church and tradition is, for the ſupporte of the verie grounds of Chriſtian faith and doctrine: and that therfore not without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe S. Paul ſtileth the church <hi>the piller: and grounde of truth.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">1. Timoth. 3.15.</note>2. Secondlie it is to be obſerued, that the preciſe matter, and forme of diuers Sacraments, and amongſt others of holie orders (which according to Catholique doctrine I ſuppoſe to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, becauſe this doth neither aduantage me, nor diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage mine aduerſarie in the preſent queſtion) are not ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either in anie Councell, or the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers, but that there are diuers probable opinions in the ſame, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable grounds that are found, either in reaſon or authoritie. For the holie councells and fathers not making ritualls, nor
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:23816:89"/> explicating at large the whole order, or manner of miniſtring all Sacraments, but deliuering to their poſteritie the practiſe of that manner, which they receiued from their Predeceſſors, do not preſcribe in what preciſe things, actions, or words the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and forme of all Sacraments de conſiſt, nor of this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, which now is in queſtion. Hence it commeth, that thoſe Catholique Doctors, that haue had occaſion to treate of this matter, finding no preciſe rule preſcribed vnto them, neither in the ſcriptures, Councells, nor Fathers, haue deliuered their iudgment thervpon diuerſlie, according to the diuers grounds which euerie one thinketh moſt probable. And therfore if any showld ſay that the eſſentiall matter of Epiſcopall order is the only impoſition of hands (which notwithſtanding I find not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by any but one only auctor) others will ioyne thervnto the vnction vſed in that action, and alſo the deliuerie of thoſe things which are exhibited in conſecration, as the booke of Gospels, the Paſtorall ſtaffe, and ring: Others excluding the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands from the order of prieſthood, as not pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the eſſence therof and therfore ſeeme alſo to exclude it from the eſſentiall mattet of epiſcopall order: none of theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions touching the matter showld be certainlie falſe, nor yet any of them certainlie true. And becauſe the common iudgment of the forme of holie order is, that it conſiſteth in thoſe words, which declare the power of the order giuen, and are vttered when the matter is deliuered, the forme likewiſe of epiſcopall order commeth to be in ſuch ſort vncertaine, as it is not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie knowne in which wordes preciſelie it doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Neither doth the church of God ſuffer anie detriment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by being aſſured, that she hath the true matter and forme, which the Apoſtles deliuered her from our ſauiour Chriſt, though it be not knowne in what words, or actions preciſelie they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: as it happeneth in like vncertaintie, and diuerſitie of opinions, about the preciſe matter and forme of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, ſome ſaying the matter therof to be the mutuall conſent of the partie, expreſſed by words of the preſent tenſe,<note place="margin">Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. de locis l. 8. cap. 5.

But he doth well to be bold in affirminge, for a good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ſometimes helpeth out an ill game.</p>
               <p n="3">3. My concluſion is, that the ſole impoſition of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds with the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe words, <hi>Receiue the holie Ghoſt,</hi> is not the whole, true, and eſſentiall matter and forme of Epiſcopall order, and conſequentlie, that thoſe, that are ordained with them alone, as our English ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents are confeſſed to be, are not trulie ordained, nor are anie true Bishops. This concluſion I prooue firſt by this nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Neither ſcriptures, Councells, Fathers, nor Diuines one only eſcepted doe teach, that the ſole impoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and theſe words <hi>Receiue the holie ghost,</hi> are the whole eſſential matter,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:23816:90"/> and forme of Epiſcopall order: therfore is it affirmed without ground. Bellarnime doth prooue in the place alleaged by M. Maſon,<note place="margin">De Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </note> that impoſition of hands doth belong to the eſſentiall matter of preeſthood, but he ioyneth therwith as more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall the deliuerie of the chalice, with the paten and hoſt, and of the matter of Epiſcopall order, he ſaith nothing. And M. Maton bringeth foure other Catholique authors, that exclude impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, from the eſſentiall matter of holie order, which sheweth that it is but probable at the moſt, that impoſition of hands pertameth, to the eſſentiall matter of holie order: but that it should be the whole and ſole eſſentiall matter, is no waie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. Neither do I thinke M. Maſon would ſaie it were proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that he is forced vnto it, not hauing other meanes to maintaine for good, the newly deuiſed maner of ordination of their Bishops, whervpon I appeale to his owne iudgment, whether that manner of ordination, deuiſed by the ſixe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, and other ſix learned in the law of God, appointed by King Edward for that purpoſe, is more like to be that manner of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, which the Apoſtles themſelues vſed, and left vnto their ſucceſſours, then that which was ouer and is ſtill vſed thorow the whole Chriſtian church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Againe whether this new forme of ordination was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by parlement, vpon anie grounded perſuaſion, that it was conformable to the manner vſed by the Apoſtles: or rather as a meane both to leaue the Catholique manner, and yet to retaine ſome externall ſemblance of ordination, the world being not yet readie to receiue the refined reformation, which we ſee ſmee to haue crept in amongſt thoſe, that haue apoſtated from the vnion of the Catholique Romane church, and by which is reiected as ſuperſtitious, not onlie this parlementarie fashion of ordination but the verie order of Bishops it ſelfe it is not verie doubtfull. And that this ſecond was the drift at leaſt of him, that firſt put into mens hartes the reuolt, and ſeparation from the vnitie of the Catholique church, it is plaine enough by the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke called; <hi>the forme and manner of ordination, and admiſsion of Pastors to their church, according to the manner of the reformed churches: Printed at</hi> Middelberrough by <hi>Richard S.

Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſenſeles and abſurd hereſies I ſee not, but M.

But I will proceed in the proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe of my concluſion.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.</hi> Secondly the vniforme doctrine of thoſe that haue written of holie order tracteth, that the matter thereof conſiſteth in the deliuerie of the inſtruments proper to euerie order, as of Deaconship the booke of the Goſpells; of prieſthood the chali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and paten with the hoſt, and ſo in the other orders: And that the forme conſiſteth in thoſe words, which are vttered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the deliuerie of the matter, and expreſſe the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie giuen by the ſame, which in deaconship are theſe. <hi>Take power to reade the Goſpell in the church of God, as well for the liuing as for the dead, in the name of our lord Amen.</hi> In preiſthood they are theſe. <hi>Take power to off her ſacrifice to God, and to celebrate maſſe as well for the liuing as for the dead, in the name of our lord. Amen.</hi> And the like in the reſt of holy orders. Therfore Epiſcopall order ought in all reaſon, to haue like matter and forme, which cannot be impoſition of hands, and theſe words <hi>Receiue the holie Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe neither the one, nor the other apart, nor yet both together do expreſſe the power giuen in that order: but they rather expreſſe the giuing of the holie Ghoſt, whereby the conſecrated is diſpoſed or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de fitt, to exerciſe well, and worthilie the power and authoritie giuen by that order.</p>
               <p>Thirdly ſeing there want not in Epiſcopall conſecration, the like ſenſible matter, and ſignifying forme, which are of all deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes confeſſed to be the eſſentiall matter and forme of other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. As for example, the anointing of the head of him that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated with holie chriſme, with theſe words <hi>Be thy head anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conſecrated with heauenlie bleſsing in Epiſcopall order:</hi> Beſides are deliuered him the paſtorall ſtaffe, the ring, the booke of Goſpels, all with ſeuerall words aptlie expreſſing the power giuen by that order, it is moſt probable that they pertaine to the eſſentiall matter, and forme of this order, I ſaie moſt probable, becauſe we haue nothing clearlie certaine in this point, neither by ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:23816:91"/>
               <p>And this doctrine for as much as concerneth the anointing of the Bishops head, which ſeemeth to ſome leaſt probable, is confirmed by the teſtimonie of moſt ancient Fathers. For S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Clement Pope and diſciple of the Apoſtles ſaith,<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>3</hi> ad vniuerſos.</note> 
                  <hi>that euery Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop anointed with holy chriſme, placed in the city, and learned in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ought to be deare, and honoured of all men.</hi> And Pacianus of equall antiquitie with S.

               <p>I know that a certaine ſchooleman of theſe daies holdeth for probable that the impoſition of hands, and theſe words <hi>accipe Spiritum Sanctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> are the true matter and forme of Epiſcopall order. His grounds are theſe. Firſt that at the leaſt three Bishops are by diuine ordinaunce neceſſarie to Epiſcopall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly. that it is neceſſary that the true miniſter of holy order apply the matter of order vnto the ordered, and therfore if one only Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op apply the matter of Epiſcopall order it is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe one Bishop alone (without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion giuen him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) is not the true miniſter of that order. Thirdly that only that action of impoſing hands is performed by all the three Bishops. Wherupon he inferreth that that action is the true matter, and the words pronounced together with the ſame, are the forme of Epiſcopall conſecration. How true or probable his diſcourſe is, I meane not here to diſpute, but (be the grounds therof what they will) I will for M Maſons adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage ſuppoſe the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be probable, which is as much as he can expect, and more then he can exact. Now what will he inferre heervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If he ſay, that his opinion concerning the matter and forme of Epiſcopall order being probable, it will follow, that their Bishops are at leaſt probably Bishops: I wil anſwere him: Firſt, that though it be probable, that impoſition of hands, and theſe words <hi>Receiue the holy Ghoſt</hi> appertaine to the eſſentiall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and forme of Epiſcopall order, yet is it not probable, that they are the whole eſſential matter and forme therof, becauſe there is no probable ground of this, as is shewed in the firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt this opinion, and therfore are not their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſo much as probable Bishops.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:23816:92"/>
               <p>Secondlie, be it probable (for the auctority of that one moderne writer nowe mentioned) that the whole eſſentiall matter, and forme of Epiſcopall order conſiſt in the impoſition of hands, and theſe words <hi>Receiue the holy Ghoſt:</hi> and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly, that their ſuperintendents are probablie Bishops; yet will it not thence follow, that it is ſo much as probable, that they haue the lawfull calling of Bishops, becauſe the lawfull calling of the Paſtors of Gods church doth not hang vpon probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but requireth vnfallible certainties, for ſo much at leaſt as appertaineth to their eſſentiall ordination, without including matter of fact: for otherwaies all their actions (as they are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Paſtors) should be but probablie canonicall, and therfore vncertaine, whence would neceſſarilie riſe an irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable confuſion in the church, which notwithſtanding is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſcripture <hi>an armie well ordered.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>M. Maſon will peraduenture yet farther obiect, that there is no mention made in the holy ſcriptures, of any other thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the eſſentiall matter, and forme of holy order, but only of impoſition of hands, and theſe words <hi>Receiue the holy Ghoſt</hi> and therfore are all other things to be reiected as mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, and not diuine ordinations. But firſt if he wilbe ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, as to accept of nothing as pertayning to the eſſentiall matter, and forme of holy order, but that which is expreſſed in holy ſcripture as appertaining therunto, without all reſpect to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:23816:92"/> the authoritie of the church and eccleſiaſticall tradition, then muſt he reiect the matter, and forme preſcribed in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall not only of Deacons, and Prieſts, which are not expreſſed in holy ſcripture, but euen thoſe wherin he would the eſſentiall matter, and forme of epiſcopall order to conſiſt. For though theſe words <hi>Receiue the holy Ghoſt</hi> are in holy ſcripture,<note place="margin">Iohn 21.</note> and that there is often mention made of impoſition of hands, yet are theſe two neuer ioined together in holy ſcripture, nor preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as the matter and forme of Epiſcopall order. In their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Whence it followeth, that if M. Maſon will either haue Deacons, Prieſts, or Bishops in their church, he muſt be forced to giue ſo much credit to the authoritie of the church and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as to receiue from them, the eſſentiall matter, and forme of theſe orders. which being ſo, he will farther euidentlie find, that their ſuperintendents hauing not bene conſecrated with that matter and forme, which the church from ancient times vſed cannot be any true Bishops.</p>
               <p>Againe, the ſcripture with impoſition of hands ioyneth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies praier in the ordination of Deacons, Prieſts, or Bishops, as appeareth in the places cited in the margent, and therfore doth the ſcripture mention ſomething vſuall in holy orders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides impoſition of hands, and theſe words <hi>Receiue the holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                  </note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated after this new manner as M.

To this propoſition of the Bishop of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Ridley replied not one word, nor pleaded any thing to the contrary, but by his ſilence shewed, that he conſented thervnto, according to the receiued maxime. <hi>Qui tacet, conſentire videtur.</hi> In which caſe he would not doubtles haue bene ſo mute (ſeeing he wanted not words in other occaſions of farre leſſe moment) had he not knowne himſelfe to haue beene not true Bishop nor truly conſecrated. Where it is to be obſerued, that M. Maſon bringeth this very obiection of D. Brookes words to Ridley,<note place="margin">

                  </note>Secondlie M.

Foxes opinion true Bishops as well as Cranmer, ſurely their deathes would in his conceipt haue equalled Bishop Fishers, or els Cranmers would not do it, in whom there was nothing more, then there was in them, excepting the true conſecration of a Bishop. So that it appeareth euen by M. Foxes iudgment, that Ridley, and his fellowes were not eſteemed true Bishops, as Cranmer was, and that not for any other defect, then for want of true conſecration.

                  <hi>the Bishop of the dioceſſe, finding otherwiſe ſufficiency and abilitie in theſe men, may ſupplie that thing which wanted in them before, and then according to his diſcretion admitt them to miniſter.</hi> For albeit M.

Yet neither doth this ſerue him to any purpoſe for the iuſtification of their calling, nor yet can it ſtand with theſe plaine words of the article: <hi>conſidering they were not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in very deed:</hi> for the plaine meaning of the article is that thoſe who had no orders, but ſuch as they had receiued by the new fashion, should (being found fit) be ordered: but ſuch as had receiued ſome orders before as of Subdeacon or Deacon, and the reſt only after the new fashion should haue that they wanted, ſupplied by their Catholique ordinarie.</p>

               <p>Bishop Bonner being priſoner in the Marshalſae was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by M.

Theſe points were firſt

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Marie did not enact by parlement, that the Maſſe should be a true Maſſe, and the Popes authoritie a true authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, what law, or other thing to the contrarie notwithſtanding, as this act of <hi>Q</hi> Elizabeth ſaith of the new ſuperintendents and of their manner of conſecration: But her act was to authoriſe the free vſe, and frequentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Maſſe, with the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Popes authoritie in her kingdome, which all her roiall progenitors, and predeceſſors had frequented, and acknowledged, ſince Ethelbert the firſt Chriſtian king of our countrie togeather with all other kings, and Princes in the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> world. So that neither the Maſſe, nor the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie depend otherwaies of the parlement, then that it may be free for euerie ſubiect of the king of England, to acknowledge both thone and thother, without incurring the penaltie of the temporall lawes. And therfore though the free vſe of them may be taken awaie, by vniuſt and vnlawfull act of parlement, as we ſee practiſed, yet can neither thone nor thother be made none by act of parlement, as it would fall out with their ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, add the manner of their conſecration, if thoſe acts we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re taken awaie, wherby they are deuiſed and authoriſed. And the reaſon hereof is manifeſt. For neither the Maſſe, nor the Popes authoritie haue their beginning and inſtitution by act of parlement, as the ordinations of our new ſuperintendents ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, and therfore can they not be made fruſtrate, and of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue by anie power of the ſame, as theſe may be. Whence it is manifeſt that by verie good reaſon, the pretended Bishops of England are called parlement Bishops, and conſequentlie no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops at all, becauſe the parlement cannot haue anie power to make Bishops: and that without all reaſon, or shew of reaſon, the Maſſe is ſaid to be a parlement maſe.

Or if it be pretended, that the Queene had any ſuch power, Let ſome ground therof be produced, if not out of ſcripture (which yet we might iuſtly exact, ſeeing they proteſt to beleeue nothing but that, which is prooued by ſcripture) yet out of ſome councell, auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at leaſt the preſident of ſome one approued fact, within the compaſſe of 1500. yeares.

For what neceſſitie could driue them to omit any thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, to the accuſtomed manner of ordination, excepting only the want of true Bishops, that would conſecrate the newly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and elected Superintendents?

But of this point of the want of true Bishops, that might conſecrate theſe new men, we shall ſpeake of D. Parkers ordination.

                           <p>Your Bishops are made (you ſay) [in forme and order] what forme and order meane you? meane you the old, which was vſed in the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:23816:101"/> firſt fiue hundreth yeares, or the new? In the old forme after the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, notice was giuen to the Bishop of Rome, and to all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the church, that ſuch a man was lawfully choſen Bishop with in the church, and not ſchiſmatically; and ſo all the other Bishops knew by the communicatory letters, to whom they should ſend, or of whom they should receiue ſuch letters. But ſo ye were not made Bishops: If ye were, shew vs to what Bishops out of England ye wrote any ſuch letters. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the custome of thoſe letters becaine to be out of vſe, the only Bishop of Rome his confirmation was in steede of the ſaid notice, and by him ſurely you were not confirmed: And yet ſeeing he is a Bishop, if you will not graunt him the confirmation, ye ought at the leaſt to put him to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your election, that he may know you to be men, with whom he may communicate. But for as much as you wrote not to him in that matter, you shew that ye be no Catholique Bishops. For neuer was there any Catholique Bishop in the church, which did not one way, or other, shew himſelfe to communicate with S. Peters ſucceſſour, from the beginning till this day.</p>
                           <p>But ye were made, you ſay, by the conſecration of the Archbishops, and other three Bishops.

Iewell, and M. Harding.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the heedfull reader, be he Catholique, or Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may clearelie ſee, how M. Iewell himſelf, (the cheeftaine of all our new maiſters in England, and haueing part in the matter being one of the Bishops about whoſe conſecration the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie is, and therfore knew well how it was performed, and neither wanting witt, nor will to maintaine it, if it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to be maintained) is by ſtrength of argument forced to yeeld the bucklers to his aduerſarie, and to confeſſe the nullitie of his owne and his fellowes conſecration, not by expreſſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the truth, for that his hereticall pride, and obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te errour would not permit him to do, but by his deepe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of his aduerſaries arguments, whervnto becauſe he could not anſwere, he let them paſſe in ſilence, as if they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne obiected againſt him at all, And this is ſpeciallie to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, in the obiection of M. Parkers conſecration, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the conſecrations of all the reſt do neceſſarilie depend, whom doubtles he either knew, not to be conſecrated at all (vnles it were done at the nagges head, after the manner that is and hath hitherto bene verie crediblie reported) or els in ſuch other ſort as being ſpecified would haue giuen his aduerſarie (whom he knew was not altogether ignorant how that matter paſſed) greater aduantage againſt him. For thou maiſt be well aſſured (good reader) that M. Iewell vndertaking to anſwere this booke of D. Hardings, if he could haue shaped but anie shifting anſwere, to thoſe preſſing points of his owne, and his fellowes calling M. Harding should haue heard from him on both eares. Iudge thou therfore of what creditt M. Maſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords are, ſeeing that M. Iewell who was Bishop himſelfe, and (without doing M. Maſon anie iote of wrong) better able to haue maintained his calling, and conſecration then he, and being vrged vnto it in ſuch ſort, as we haue ſeene, is driuen into ſuch an abſolute non plus about the ſame, that he hath not one
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:23816:102" rendition="simple:additions"/> wiſe word to ſaie in his owne iuſtification. Surelie it muſt needs be, that either theſe records were not then coined, or if they were, yet were they of ſmall force, for the iuſtification of the new manner of ordination. For no man of ordinarie ſenſe can thinke, that either M. Iewell knew them not at all, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them did not vnderſtand, of what force they were, for the iuſtifying of his owne calling, ſuppoſing they were of anie at all.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, I haue related this diſpute at large, that the reader, who hath not the meanes to reade Harding, in his owne boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, but onelie as M. Iewell relateth his words, may ſee, how eaſilie he may be deceiued therin. For as in this particuler point, ſo in all others he leaueth out that, which doth moſt preſſe; and relateth onlie thoſe things, whervnto he thinketh he may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſome ſuch shufling anſwere, that he may be by the more i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorant ſort eſteemed, to haue ſatisfied his aduerſarie. And this I would all men, that reade him, should take notice of, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Proteſtants, or otherwaies: For hardlies hall a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> find a more colouring, and leſſe ſolide or ſubſtantiall aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Catholique religion, then is M. Iewell, being read with attention.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And to conclude this chapter it is farther to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that nor D. Harding onlie, but all or moſt of the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que writers of our owne countrie (to ſaie nothing of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) hauing in expreſſe words, obiected to the new ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents, intruded into Bishopricks in the beginning of Q.

               <p>If M. Parker were not conſecrated Archbishop, after the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me manner that S.

               <p>M. Maſon bringeth diuers coniectures of M. Barlowes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, but not one haft proofe. <hi>He diſcharged</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all things belonging to the order of a Bishop, euen Epiſcepall conſecration: therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:23816:106"/> doubtles was he conſecrated.</hi> But by the like forme of argument might he be prooued to haue beene a lawfull husband, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe he had a Woman, and diuers children. Which kind of proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe how current ſoeuer it may be in M. Maſons logicke, yet in it ſelf it is ridiculous, as euidently ſuppoſing that for a truth, which is in queſtion, and therby begging that which he should prooue. For vnles he firſt ſuppoſe, that M Barlow was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated himſelfe, which is the thing in queſtion, to ſay that he did helpe to conſecrate others, doth prooue nothing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he could farther prooue, or that it were graunted him, that M. Barlow neuer did any thing in that kind, but that he might lawfully doe, which I ſuppoſe M. Maſon will not eaſilie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prooue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>he was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>generally acknowledged, and obeied as a Bishop.</hi> So I thinke he will not denie, but. Ridley, Hooper, Farrer, and the reſt of their creation were, during the time they held the roomes of Bishops, and yet were they iudged, both by the Spirituall, and temporall court, as we haue ſeene before, not to haue bene conſecrated, therfore this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument prooueth nothing to the purpoſe but a popular er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, grounded vpon the vniuſt poſſeſſion of a Bishopricke. And much leſſe doth that prooue any thing, which he addeth, ſaying <hi>that Bucanan called him Bishop of S. Dauids.</hi> For it is no ſtraunge thing, that he that hath a Bishopricke, should be called Bishop eſpecially by a ſtranger, to whoſe teſtimony M. Maſon recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in this matter, doth shew that he is hard ſett for proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes.</p>
               <p>Theſe are M. Maſons coniectures of M. Barlowes conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, if the caſe should be brought into any indifferent court, would not I dare ſay ſuffice to prooue his conſecration. For ſeing that no ſimple prieſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be beleeued, that he is a Prieſt, without the letters of his ordination (eſpecially where there is doubt of his prieſthood) much leſſe ought a Bishop to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued to be a Bishop, without authenticall records of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
               <p>And is there not therfore in all Bishops, and Archbishops ſees, an office of regiſter, where all the ordinations are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the end that euery one truly ordained may haue at all times authenticall <hi>conſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:23816:106"/> vnleſſe the records perish by fire, or other extraordinary acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (which cannot be ſaid in M. Barlowes caſe) no man can faile of proofe of his orders, which in Bishops is by ſo much more certaine, by how much more diligence there is vſed the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, by reaſon of the great inconuenience which would enſue, if any ſuch default should happen. Seeing therfore the records of M. Barlowes conſecration do not appeare, (in ſo much that M. Maſon is forced to prooue it by coniecture, as we haue ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: Wheras he citeth the regiſters of the conſecrations of all the reſt but his) nor yet haue miſcaried by any extraordinary accident happening to the metropolitanes regiſters, how can he be iudged to haue bene truly conſecrated? Eſpecially ſeeing (as M. Maſon ſaith) the regiſters of Cranmer beare record of his (I meane M. Barlowes) preferment to the priory of Bishame, of his election to the Bishopricke of S.

               <p>And what I pray you was the reaſon, that M.

Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths raigne (wherof M. Parker was one) paſſed, by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as were preſent therat. At the nagges head in Cheapſide by accorded appointment mett all thoſe that were nominated to Bishoprickes vacant either by death, as was that of Canterbury only, or by vniuſt depoſition, as were all the reſt: their names are ſet downe in the chapter following. Thither came alſo the old Bishop of Landaffe to make them Bishops, which thing being knowne to D. Bonner Bishop of London then priſoner, he ſent vnto the Bishop of Landaffe, forbidding him vnder paine of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication to exerciſe any ſuch power within his Dioceſſe, as to order thoſe men, wherwith the old Bishop being terrified, and otherwiſe alſo moued in his owne conſcience refuſed to proceede in that action, alleadging chiefly for reaſon of his forbearance his want of ſight as is before ſaid: which excuſe they interpreting to be but an euaſion were much mooued againſt the poore old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and wheras hitherto they had vſed him with all curteſie and reſpect, they then turned their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, reuiling and calling him doating foole, and the like ſome of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:23816:107"/> them ſaying. <hi>This old foole thinketh we cannot be Bishops vnles we be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> to the diſgrace as well of him, as of the Catholique manner of epiſcopall conſecration. Being notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding thus deceiued of their expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and hauing no other meane to come to their deſire, they reſolued to vſe M. Scories helpe, who hauing bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the name of Bishop in king Edwards time, was though to haue ſufficient power to performe that office, eſpecially in ſuch a ſtreate neceſſity. He hauing caſt of together with his religious habite (for he had bene a religious man) all ſcruple of conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce willingly went about the matter, which he performed in this ſort, hauing the Bible in his hand, and they all kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he laid it vpon euery one of their heads or shoulders ſaying, <hi>Take thou authority to preach the word of God ſincerely.</hi> And ſo they roſe vp Bishops.</p>
               <p>This whole narration without adding or detracting any word pertaining to the ſubſtance of the matter, I haue heard oftener then once of M. Thomas Bluet a graue, learned, and iudicious prieſt. He hauing receiued it of M. Neale a man of good ſort and reputation, ſometimes reader of the Hebrew or Greeke Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (I remember not whether) in Oxford: But when this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſed, was belonging to Bishop Bonner, and ſent by him to deliuer the meſſage before mentioned to the Bishop of Landaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, and withall to attend there to ſee the end of the buſines. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine M. Bluet had other good meanes to be informed of this matter being long time priſoner together with D. Watſon Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Lincolne, and diuers other men of marke of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cleargy, in whoſe time and in whoſe ſight, as a man may ſay, this matter was done. Of this narration there are (I thieke) as many witneſſes yet liuing as there are prieſts remaining aliue, that haue bene priſoners together with M. Bluet in Wisbich ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, where I alſo heard it of him.</p>
               <p>M.<note place="margin">What law doth he meane that they should haue incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red daunger of.</note> Maſon in the appendix to his booke hauing related this ſame thing out of Sacro Boſco (who had heard it from the ſame partie for he was alſo priſoner ſometime in Wisbich caſtle) for anſwere ſaith. <hi>No man of reaſon can imagine that they would goe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate one another in a tauerne, and ſo incurre the daunger of the law, after they had according to their harts deſire an Archbishop of their owne religion, quietly poſſeſſed of his church and chaire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is nothing to the purpoſe. For he ſuppoſeth M. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:23816:108"/> to haue bene conſecrated, and already inſtalled in his church and chaire before this ſolemne meeting at the nagges head, wheras the obiection wherunto he anſwereth ſaith the contrarie, and includeth M. Parker with the reſt, as one of the number to be conſecrated there, and therfore is his anſwere very friuolous. Peraduenture he thinketh that he that alreadie prooued M. Parkers conſecration ſo fully by producing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, that it cannot be denied, and therfore ſuppoſeth it in this his anſwere as cleare. But ſeeing his regiſters are found ſo full of crakes and flawes, that they neede to be made good by other proofes then yet appeare, they cannot in any indifferent mans iudgment be holden for good proofes of that which is here in queſtion; when he ſaith, <hi>that they hauing quiet poſſeſſion of churches it cannot be probable that they would goe to a tauerne to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated:</hi> he ſpeaketh with more shew of reaſon then in any thing he hath ſaid of this matter in his whole booke before, and yet this is alſo eaſily and truly anſwered, for it is not ſaid that they went to the tauerne to be conſecrated, becauſe they had not the liberty of churches, but the reaſon was becauſe they being out of all hope or expectation to draw the old Bishop of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daffe (by whom they thouhgt they should be conſecrated) to their church with them, they made no difficultie or ſcruple to reſort to ſuch a place, as he would be content to come vnto, and ſo it came to paſſe that their meeting was at the nags head, as is ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Not only Catholiques, who by our aduerſaries may be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of partialitie, are witneſſes in this matter, but Iohn Stow a Proteſtant hath teſtified the ſame, not in writing, for that he durſt not, though he had diligentlie ſought out all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers therof, but in words to ſome perſons that are yet liuing, and of moſt entire credit and fidelitie, who notwithſtanding being no leſſe fearefull to witnes this of him though now dead, then he himſelfe was to write it being aliue, cannot here be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But that this is true I can giue this moſt probable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be no more then probable, Stow in his Chronicle maketh no more mention of the conſecration of theſe new prelates, or any thing belonging thervnto, then if there neuer had bene any ſuch matter, no not ſo much as of M. Parkers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration or enſtalling, which ſilence, all circumſtances conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23816:108"/> could not proceed from any other reaſon, then from feare of offending by ſaying the truth. For firſt it is euident that he is carefull to ſet downe all occurrents worthy of any memorie, (eſpecially happening about London) though of farre leſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then this. Secondlie he profeſſeth ſpeciall loue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to M. Parker, and therfore ſetteth downe many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of him, of much leſſe moment, then is his conſecration or enſtalling. Thirdly not only he, but all other Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers take diligent care not to omit any innouation, or change of old cuſtomes or fashions into new, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie in a matter of ſuch moment as this is. Fourthlie he ſetteth downe the conſecration, enſtalling receiuing the pall, yea and the firſt maſſe of Cardinall Pole, M. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers immediate predeceſſour. All which were but ordinarie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents in other Archbishops, much leſſe therfore could he forget to ſet downe the conſecration of M. Parker, which was ſo new and extraordinarie, as M. Maſon himſelfe ſaith, it was ſinguler and vnlike to all thoſe that went before ſince S. Auſtin the firſt Archbishop of that ſee, and might as truly haue ſaid ſince Chriſt his time.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, beſides many other things pertaining to the change of religion, ſet downe by him in that yeare 1559. of farre leſſe conſideration then is the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a new cleargie: he putteth downe the depriuation (ſo he calleth it) of the old Bishops in the moneth of Iuly, which could not permit him to forget the creation of the new ones, eſpeciallie he hauing ioined together before in Q. Maries time, the reſtitution of Bishop Bonner,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">

But this taketh not away the difficultie. For he might for all that be conſecrated Bishop as well as D. Barlow, whom he calleth in the ſame place Bishop of Chicheſter elect, and D. Scory whom he calleth Bishop of Hereford elect, which two notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding are ſuppoſed to haue bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated long before that time.

Grindall, tearming thone abſolutely Bishop of London without all reſtriction, becauſe he was already enſtalled and in poſſeſſion of his Brishopricke, and thother only Archbishop elect for want of the ſame circumſtance. If therfore D. Parker and D. Grindall were Bishops in the moneth of September the yeare 1559. as by the teſtimonie of Stowe they appeare to haue bene, what verity can there be in M.

                  </note>It is alſo to be vnderſtood, that at the ſame time, when there was queſtion of conſecrating theſe new Bishops, there was priſoner in the tower of London an Archbishop of Ireland, who was offered his libertie and diuers other rewards, if he would haue conſecrated the newly elected Bishops, which doubtles argueth the want of others, that were (euen by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues) eſteemed true Bishops, for if ſuch had bene at hand, they would not haue recurred to him, with daunger to receiue a

               <p n="6">6. The reſt of M. Parkers conſecrators, according to M. Maſons accoumpt to wit M. Scory and M Couerdall were of the new conſecration, deuiſed in K. Edward the 6. his time, and therfore found euen by the iudges of the Realme, to be no Bishops, as is before shewed.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 93.</note> And is euidentlie prooued out of M. Maſons owne records and teſtimonies. For they were conſecrated, as M. Maſon ſaith the 30. of Auguſt 1551. to wit fiue moneths before the new forme of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was ſe forth or allowed, which was done in the parlement holden the 5. and 6. yeare of Edward the 6. as appeareth both by the ſtatute it ſelfe, which is the firſt of that parlement, as alſo by the firſt ſtatute of the 8. of Elizabeth: but this parlement of the 5. and 6. of Edw. the 6. began the 13. of Ianuarie 1551. that is foure moneths and more after the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of Scorie and Couerdall. For by the coumpt of England the yeare beginneth in March, and not in Ianuarie as all men know. Euident therfore it is that they could not be conſecrated by the new forme: and no leſſe euident it is, that they were not conſecrated by the old forme;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag</hi> 94.</note> for that (as M. Maſon confeſſeth) was abrogated in the parlement of the third and fourth of Ed. the 6. and appeareth alſo by the 12. ſtatute of that parlement. Soe that it is cleare that theſe two conſecrators of M. Parker were neuer conſecrated at all neither by one forme or other. And therfore had there bene none other defect in M. Parkers conſecration (as diuers others haue bene already prooued) but only this, that his conſecrators were not conſecrated, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no true Bishops, it is more then ſufficient to prooue his want of conſecration, and conſequently his want of all true calling.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all which ſo blind is M. Maſon, either through his affection to new falshood, or hatred to auncient truth, that he blusheth not to write in this ſort. <hi>Thus haue we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the place, the perſons, the matter, the forme of his</hi> (M. Parker) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, and find nothing but agreable to the lawes of the land, the Canons of the church, and the practice of reuerend antiquity.</hi> Do not thinke (good Reader) that I exceeded in ſaying, that M. Maſon was blinded by affection when he wrote theſe words for he himſelf
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:23816:110"/> doth euidently prooue it, not ſeeing what he wrote, but only ten or twelue lines before in theſe words. <hi>This was his ſinguller feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that being the</hi> 70. <hi>Archbishop after Auſtin yet was the firſt of all, which receiued conſecration without the Popes buls &amp;c.</hi> For if he were the firſt, that was conſecrated in this manner, how doth his conſecration agree, either with the lawes of the land which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant before this new manner of conſecration was deuiſed many ages; and much leſſe is it agreeable with the Canons of the church, and venerable antiquitie? Wherfore to make this ſpeach of his agree aſwell with that, which he ſaid before, as alſo with the truth it ſelfe, he muſt wipe out this litle word <hi>(but)</hi> and ſo shall his ſaying be moſt true in it ſelfe, and conformable to his former words. Yet doth he shew himſelf more ſenſeles in that which followeth, adding; <hi>wherin how circumſpectly the Queene proceeded, may further appeare by this, that her letters patenet were ſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to diuers learned profeſſors of the law, that they might freely giue their iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and all of them iointly confeſſed, that both the Queenes maieſty might lawfully authorize, the perſons to the effect ſpecified</hi> (which was to conſecrate M.

For, ſuppoſe that theſe men had bene as great diuines as S Auguſtin: as abſolute lawiers as Barthold, as conſtant and vncorrupt as Curius Dentatus, and withall, not ſubiect to her that demaunded their reſolution, and therby more like ad to deliuer their opinions with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie. of what moment should their iudgment be, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that of the whole Chriſtian world from the Apoſtles time, till the raigne of King Edward the 6. For if in all this compaſſe either of time or place, including alſo the Apoſtles themſelues, M. Maſon can bring one inſtance, or example of a Bishop ordered in this ſort, that M. Parker was, he shall gaine his cauſe. To bring therfore the approbation of halfe a dozen very ordinarie lawiers, no diuines, of no extraordinarie repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for their integritie, and no more then ordinarie for their courage, and conſtancie, ſubiects to her that demaunded their opinions, a princeſſe peremptorie in her proceedings, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie abſolutelie reſolued in her determination, whatſoeuer
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:23816:110"/> their reſolution should bee: demaunding their opinions (which she knew before hand would be according to her will) only for a ſlender maske, or pretence of ſome colour of law; to bring ſix ſuch mens iudgment (I ſay) againſt the iudgment, and practice of the whole Chriſtian world (for nor only Catholiques, whom they ttulie eſteeme enemies to their hereſie, though not to their perſons, but all their owne brethren of the pretended reformation in France, Geneua, Germanie, Poland, Hungarie, Holland, Scotland, yea and in England it ſelfe, for the greater or at leaſt for the more Zealous part, do all condemne, and diſauowe their parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Bishops, and cleargie) is not this I ſay moſt perfect ſenſleſnes? Surelie ſuch an argument is moſt fit to conclude, and shut vp in all ſecuritie, the ordination of the firſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan of ſo new a cleargie. Yet this default I do not ſo much aſcribe to the want of iudgment in M.

               <p>After all this M. Maſon filleth eight pages in deriuing the deſcent of their new cleargie from M. Parker, who being the firſt of that race (as M. Maſon willinglie profeſſeth) and yet not of full fiftie yeares antiquitie, their church wherof he was the firſt Paſtor, cannot poſſiblie be the church of Chriſt, yet M.

               <p>What high credit or reputation his records are of, I leaue to the vnpartiall reader to iudge by that which hath bene hitherto ſaid therof. And for the new proofe which he addeth heere of M. Parkers conſecration ſaying <hi>it was published in print in his owne time without being called in queſtion,</hi> it is a manifeſt vntruth.

Therfore if there were any ſuch thing pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in print, as M.

Thus you ſee that though Athanaſius fled away in time of perſecution, though he were depoſed by a councell, and another choſen in his place, with the conſent of the Emperour: yet for all this he is iudged to be the true Bishop of Alexandria, and Gregory ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to haue bene Bishop therof. The like is to be ſaid of Marcellus Bishop of Ancyra, Aſclepas Bishop of Gaza, Paulus Bishop of Conſtantinople, and others, who were perſecuted for the Catholique faith, as well as Athanaſius.

               </p>
               <p>If M. Maſon can apply this rightly to that purpoſe, for which he bringeth it, he shall no doubt gaine his cauſe. For the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:23816:112"/> he vſeth is authenticall. But he doth in this as one, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſtolne another mans euidence, and records, produceth them againſt the right owner, thinking therby to diſpoſeſſe him of his inheritance, but in fine the matter being brough to light he is ouerthrowne by the ſame proofes, which he allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for himſelf. So no doubt will it fall out with M. Maſon in this allegation. For I do not thinke, that any man could ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue brought any thing more direct, either againſt thoſe in whoſe behalfe he bringeth it, or for them of whom the queſtion is here to wit Bishop Heath, Thurlby Bonner, and the reſt of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low confeſſours depoſed by Queen Elyzabeth, whoſe caſe in all reſpects like vnto that of S. Athanaſius, Marcellus, Aſclepas, and their Catholique conſorts. And contrariwiſe the caſe of Young, Grindall, Horne, with the reſt of their crewe, wherof I count Barlow, Couerdall, and the reſt of K. Edw. Bishops, becauſe their ordination is the ſame with thothers like to that of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, Bafil, Quintianus and the others intruded by the Arian Emperour Conſtantius. Yet this diſparity there is betwixt the fact of Conſtantius, diſplacing Athanaſius with the other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Bishops, and intruding Gregory and his fellowes into their ſees: and the fact of Q. Elizabeth diſpoſſeſſing Bishop Heath and Bonner with the reſt, and thruſting into their places M. Young, Grindall, and others: that Conſtantius ſeemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed canonically in this fact, hauing the colour, and shew of the ſentence of two Synodes, to wit of Tyre and Antioch, though both hereticall aſſemblies, for the diſplacing of S. Athanaſius; wheras Q. Elizabeth made no difficulty, nor had any ſcruple to thruſt Catholique Bishops out of their ſees, and intrude others into their roomes, without all shew, or colour of canonicall iudgment. So that the Arian Emperour Conſtantius, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Bishops were much more religious in appearance then Q. Elizabeth, and the Bishops of her creation, ſeeing they made ſcruple to commit ſo vniuſt and ſacrilegious a fact, as to depoſe Catholique Bishops, and thruſt others in their roomes, without shew at leaſt of ſome Eccleſiaſticall and canonicall iudgment, wherof theſe made no difficulty. And if in defence of Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths fact it be replied, that she being the head of the church of England, might do that she did of her abſolute power, without the iudgment, or ſentence of any Synode, what shall we ſay of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:23816:113"/> Conſtantius his fact? For if Q Elizabeth was head of the church of England, he muſt neceſſarily be head of the church of the Empire, and therfore if her fact were iuſtifiable for that reaſon, his was iuſtifiable for the ſame, which notwithſtanding was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the councell. But it is euident, if any thing that is paſt be euident, that neither Conſtantius though an heretique, nor any other Emperour, King, or Prince, before Henry the 8. of England, Father to Q. Elizabeth, did euer challenge, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be head of the church, or to haue any iuriſdiction in ſpirituall cauſes and matters, Farther then the power to putt in execution, the decrees and ordinances of the church. And this very caſe of the depoſition of Athanaſius doth ſufficiently shew thus much of Conſtantius, who did no more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> putt in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the vniuſt decrees, of the two hereticall aſſemblies before mentioned, which decrees he would not haue expected for the depoſition of S. Athanaſius, had he eſteemed himſelfe head of the church. Farther had he bene head of the church, what power could there haue remained in the church, to reuerſe his ſentence, which notwithſtanding we ſee done in the councell of Sardis.</p>
               <p n="4">4. M. Maſon, or ſome other in his behalfe will demaund the reaſons, why this decree of the councell of Sardis for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of S. Athanaſius, and the depoſition of Gregory the intruder, may not be as fitly applied to prooue the reſtitution of Barlow, Couerdall, and others, together with the creation of Young, Grindall, and their fellowes by Q. Elizabeth, and the depoſition of Heath, Bonner, and the reſt to be, lawfull? as we ſay it may be applied, to prooue the depoſition of Heath and Bonner, with their fellowes, and the intruſion of Young, Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, and their company to be vnlawfull? I anſwere that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon herof is euident. For this decree of the councell of Sardis being made, (as M. Maſon truly noteth) in the behalfe of the Catholique Bishops extruded by the hereticall party, who entred as wolues, and were not Bishops, as the councell decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, cannot in any shew of reaſon be applied, or wreſted, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the hereticall party in preiudice of the Catholique. True, will M. Maſon ſay: But why should the Bishops putt out of their ſeas by Q. Elizabeth, be eſteemed Catholiques, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then thoſe that she putt into their places? Marrie for the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:23816:113" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſelfe ſame reaſon, for which S. Athanaſius and his fellowes we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re eſteemed, and were indeed true Catholique Bishops, and their aduerſaries heretiques. And if M. Maſon aske what that reaſon was: I anſwere, that it was becauſe S. Athanaſius, and the reſt reſtored by the councell of Sardis, did communicate both in faith and Sacraments, with the whole Catholique church, both preſent and precedent, as alſo the Bishops, thruſt out of their ſees by Q. Elizabeth, are knowne to haue done: wheras their aduerſaries, to wit, the Arians, made a ſect apart not heard of, before Arius reuolted from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique church, breaking communion therwith both in faith and Sacraments; as in like ſort, the Bishops intruded by Q. Elizabeth, who ſeparated themſelues from the vnity of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique church, and made a ſect apart, neuer heard of in the world before Luthers reuolt, and apoſtacy. And if M. Maſon or any other can bring any thing to prooue Barlowe. Young, Grindall, with the reſt of their confeſſion to be Catholiques, which the Arrian Bihops Gregory, Baſil and Quinrianus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and condemned by the councell of Sardis, could not with as much, or more shew of truth, haue brought for themſelues; or contrariewiſe if he can alleadge any one thing to prooue, that S. Athanaſius was a Catholique, which may with the ſame truth be alleaged for Bishop Heath, and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, he shall gaine his cauſe in this point. And therfore do I conclude with M. Maſons owne words againſt himſelfe in this ſort. <hi>Wherfore if you will conforme your iudgment to the councell of Sardis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 129.</note> 
                  <hi>you must confeſſe that the Bishops depoſed by Q. Elizabeth, were the true Bishops of their ſees, and thoſe that inuaded rheir churches, were intruders and vſurpers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And this is Farther prooued, by the continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the whole church, euen from the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, wherin is not to be found one example of ſo many Bishops depoſed, and thruſt out of their ſees, without the iudgment and ſentence of a councell. It is true that ſome princes vpon vniuſt indignation, haue forced diuers holy Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops to leaue their ſees, and tranſport themſelues into other countries, as (not going any Farther for examples) Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rufus did by S. Anſelme and H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:23816:114"/> places, ſo long as their cauſe was not iudged by eccleſiaſticall ſentence. And if any be found to haue proceeded further, to the iniuſt intruſion of ſome one, into the place of another v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuſtly depoſed, without a ſynodicall ſentence yet none was euer found, to haue proceeded in that ſort againſt all the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops of a whole realme, but Q. Elizabeth, the firſt woman head of the church, that euer was in the world. And therfore no doubt, but if the caſe of the depoſed should be examined, by a Synod of lawfull Bishops (to whom the hearing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining therof doth only pertaine) they would be iudged to haue bene the true Bishops of thoſe ſees, and thothers to be intruders, and vſurpres, not entring into the fold of Chriſt by the dore of canonicall election, and conſecration, but climing vpp an other way by the power, and force of the ſecular Prince, and therfore could not be true paſtors, but theeues and robbers, as our ſauiour himſelfe teſtifieth of them.<note place="margin">

Therfore their ſentence and iudgment of depoſition pronounced againſt them could not be lawfull.</p>
               <p>In this whole argument there is nothing that needeth proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, but only the ſecond propoſition, which I will make good both by diuine, and humane authority, ſuppoſing firſt, that which is euident and cannot be denied, to wit, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties iudged were Bishops, the cauſe a point, or article of faith and religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that the iudges were lay, or ſeculer perſons. This being preſuppoſed I ſay thus.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who are appointed, and authoriſed by God, to teach vnto others all matters of faith, and religion, cannot in the ſame matters of faith and religion be ſubiect to their iudgment, who are bound to heare and learne the ſame of them: for otherwaies the ſcholler should be aboue his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter euen in that, wherin he is his maiſter, contrary both to the light of reaſon, and the expreſſe doctrine of our Sauiour Chriſt. But the Bishops, and Paſtors of Gods church are appointed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 10.24</note> and authoriſed by him, to teach all temporall men, as well the higheſt Princes, as the meaneſt people, all matters of faith, and religion. Terfore the Bishops, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of Gods church cannot be ſubiect to temporall mens iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (though they be princes) in matters of faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And conſequently temporall Princes cannot haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or power to iudge them therin. Whence it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently concluded, that the Qeeene and her councell, being ſeculer, or lay perſons had not, nor could haue any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and competent power, ouer theſe Bishops in the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe iudged by them. I adde of purpoſe theſe words (in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith and religion) becauſe I will not enter he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re into that other queſtion, whether eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are exempted in all cauſes, from the iudgment of the

               <p>The firſt propoſition of this argument, being of it ſelfe cleare to all men of any vnderſtanding, and the concluſion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing directlie of the premiſes, there remaineth only the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition, which may ſeeme to haue neede of proofe. Notwithſtanding in proouing this, will I alſo prooue thother, for the fuller ſatisfaction of thoſe, that may haue any doubt therof. That Bishops therfore and Paſtors are authoriſed by God, to teach all men their faith, and beleefe, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition cheeflie to be prooued, it is euident by the teſtimonie of our Sauiour himſelfe, ſaying: <hi>All power is giuen me in heauen,</hi>

               <p>The ſame propoſition together with thother, <hi>that Bishops can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be iudged in matters of religion by ſeculer perſons,</hi> is as euidentlie proued by the teſtimonie likewiſe of our Sauiour himſelfe, ſaying to thoſe whom he ſent to preach. <hi>He that heareth you, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:23816:118"/> did penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce all his life after, for that fearefull ſpeach, knowing and confeſſing that he being a Bishop, and therfore bound to inſtruct others, as hauing charge ouer their ſoules, should not haue ſpoken in that doubtfull manner, but should haue ſaid, that it was whollie repugnant to holy ſcriptures, that others might therby haue bene kept from errour.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, what authoritie can a ſynode of the Bishops of one only nation haue, being aſſembled by the commaundement of their owne King within his owne dominions, in a matter moſt earneſtly affected, and purſued by him: what authoritie I ſay, can ſuch a ſynode haue againſt the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all the whole world beſides? Firſt this ſynode if it be to be called ſo, was no lawfull or generall councell, as the weight and moment of that matter would haue required. Secondly, it was no free councell, as appeareth as well by the circumſtances already mentioned, as by the changing of their opinions afterwards, which only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration (of want of freedome) is ſufficient to make it of none authoritie, as it did that great councell of Arriminum, which after the threates of the Arrian Emperour Conſtantius, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer holden to bee free councell, nor the decrees therfore of any force. Therfore (to apply all that which hath hitherto bene ſaid to the matter now in queſtion) if there had bene any iuſt cauſe of depoſition probablie ſuſpected in Bishop Heath, and the reſt, why was not their cauſe committed to the examination of the reſt of the Bishops of the church, as the cuſtome groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon manifeſt reaſon, and equitie hath euer bene, in caſes of difference betweene Bishops and their owne Prince? In which caſe if they had bene found culpable, their depoſition had bene iuſtifiable to all the world. But they were well knowne to be without all fault worthie of depoſition, nor could in any equall, or cempetent iudgment, haue bene found guiltie of any crime deſeruing it: Therfore their depoſition being already decreed, to make roome for thoſe that were to be intruded, it was neceſſarie they should be iudged by ſuch, as would aſſuredlie find them guiltie, though they were neuer ſo innocent.</p>
               <p>The caſe of theſe venerable Prelates being thus, as hath bene mentioned, Let any indifferent man iudge, whether their depoſition was iuſt, or no, and conſequentlie, whether
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:23816:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> thoſe, that were thruſt into their roomes, were lawfullie inueſted therin.</p>
               <p>M. Maſon from the page 106. to the page 113. laboureth to iuſtifie the depoſition of theſe Bishops by the example of Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depoſed by Solomon. His argument in briefe is this. Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon depoſed Abiather high Prieſt, and put another in his place.</p>
               <p>Therfore Queene Elizabeth might do the like by the Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops of her kingdome. I anſwere that though we should ſuppoſe,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.26.</note> firſt that the fact of Salomon was iuſt and lawfull which is not euident. Secondly that he did depoſe Abiather as King and not as a Prophet, by ſpeciall reuelation or warrant which is vncertame. Thirdly, that the Prieſts and Prieſthood of the old and new law are of equall dignitie and priuiledge, which with all true Chriſtians is euidentlie falſe. Though (I ſay) we should ſuppoſe all theſe things, yet is this argument alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impertinent for M. Maſons purpoſe. For Abiathers caſe was altogether different from that of the Catholique Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, of whom the queſtion is here: his caſe being meerelie temporall, to wit the conſpiring againſt Salomon in behalfe of his brother Adonias, which had it not bene in the perſon of a Prieſt, should without all controuerſie haue belonged to the triall of the temporall tribunall, wheras theirs was a caſe of faith and religion, which though it had not bene in the perſons of Prieſts, yet could it not haue bene iudged by the temporall Magiſtrate, as is alreadie shewed both by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and humane, Eccleſiaſticall and temporall, imperiall and regall authoritie. Moſt impertinentlie therfore is this fact of Salomon depoſing Abiather, alleaged for the iuſtification of that of Queene Elizabeth depoſing the Catholique Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops.</p>
               <p>After this argument of Abiathers depoſition, M. Maſon putteth great force, he ſweateth hard in iuſtifying the oath of ſupremacie, for refuſall wherof he confeſſeth the old Bishops to haue bene depoſed. And for anſwere (beſides that which hath bene alreadie ſaid in this chapter for proofe of the contrarie) I will remit the reader to the laſt chapter of this treatiſe, where he shall find how oppoſite the oath of ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie is to the Proteſtants owne doctrine, and therfore needeth no other refutation by the Catholique partie.</p>

                  <hi>The ſixteenth Chapter.</hi> Of the oath of the Princes ſupremacie, for denying wherof the old Bishops were depriued.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THIS is the title of the third chapter of M. Maſons; booke. Where firſt is to be noted, the true cauſe of the depriuation of the Bishops to haue bene the refuſall to ſweare, that the Queene was ſupreame had of the church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in ſpirituall cauſes. And therfore the; other points obiected againſt them by M. Maſon, and already reiected, are meere impertinencies of his owne.

Maſon bringeth for the proofe of this ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, and not to prooue the contrarie, which is alreadie performed in the precedent chapter. To come therfore to the point, M. Maſon hauing in the beginning of this chapter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, for the proofe of the Queenes ſupremacie in ſpirituall cauſes, that Marcian, Iuſtinian, Theodoſius, and Gratian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours made lawes pertaining to Eccleſiaſticall affaires, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the ſame allegation by ſaying, that theſe Princes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed therin the determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Synodes, which he would haue to be true alſo in Q.

               </p>
               <p>But firſt M. Maso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bringeth no one fact of any one of all theſe, proouing the practiſe of this ſupremacy, which was very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary he should haue done. Secondly, by this anſwere, if he will
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:23816:119"/> ſtand therunto, it wilbe very eaſy to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince him either of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, againſt the Queene if shee were liuemg and her lawes, or of manifeſt falſi y. For if he ſay, that by the oath of ſupremacy, he aſcribeth to the Queene no other power then that, which theſe Emperours practiſed, he shall by the lawes of England be guilty of high treaſon; they hauing neuer practiſed any other power in eccleſiaſticall affaires, then that which ſtandeth well with the ſupremacy of the Bishop of Rome, which M.

If he aſcribe vnto her by the oath, any other power then that may ſtand with the Popes ſupremacy, then is that falſe, which he here affirmeth, to wit, that by the oath of ſupremacy, they aſcribe no other power to the Quene, then theſe Emperours practiſed. The teſtimonies before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of Conſtantine, and Theodoſius owne mouthes, as they are faithfully related by authenticall authors, do prooue for their parts, that they neuer practiſed any power, which did not ſtand well with the Popes ſupremacy. And as for Gratian, M. Maſon himſelf confeſſeth, that in making lawes pertaining to eccleſiaſticall matters, he followed the determination of Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and therfore did not take vpon him ſupreame iudgment therin. Charles the great is ſo farre from the practiſe of ſuprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me power of the church, that he alleadgeth and approoueth the examples, and ſayings of Conſtantine, and of Valentinian Emperours for the contrary, ſaying.<note place="margin">Capitulari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>When the Councell of Epheſus, by the packing of Dioſcorus had allowed the curſed opinion of Eutiches, and depoſed Flauianus Bishop of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Pope Leo vpon this occaſion wrote thus vnto the Emperour Theodoſius. Behold most Chriſtian and reuerend Emperour,</hi> I, <hi>with the reſt of my fellow Bishops make ſupplication vnto you, that all things may ſtand in the ſame ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23816:120"/> in which they were before theſe iudgments, vntill a greater number of Bishops may be gathered out of the whole world. Who made this ſupplication? Pope Leo an holy, and learned Pope. To whom? To the Emperour Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius. For what? that all things might stand in their former ſtate. What things meaneth he? The higheſt myſteries of religion, concerning the natures and perſon of Chriſt. But what is it to stand in the former ſtate? That is might be lawfull for all men, ſo to iudge and ſpeake of theſe holy miſteries, as they did before the ſpringing vp of the Eutichian hereſy: for then they held the truth according to the Apoſtolique faith. And this he beſeecheth the Emperour to commaund, notwithſtanding the contrary determination of the councell of Epheſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a great deale of Cry, but to litle purpoſe S. Leo intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Emperour Theodoſius, that notwithſtanding the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent iudgment, of the hereticall aſſembly holden at Epheſus, wherby the Catholique faith was euidently impugned, and the Eutichian hereſie approoued, he would commaund that all things should remaine in the ſame ſtate, they were before that wicked iudgment. Therfore (inferreth M. Maſon) hath the Emperour authority to commaund what to iudge: and ſpeake in the higheſt miſteries of religion, concerning the perſon and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſt. A ſtrange illation. If Clement the ſeauenth had written in the ſame tearmes to Henry the 8. concerning the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of ſupreame head of the church, giuen him by the Synode of Bishops mentioned before by M. Maſon (as doubtles he would haue done, if he had had the like occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hope, that he would haue hearkened to his requeſt, as S. Leo had of Theodoſius) M. Maſon would not for all that (I ſuppoſe) inferr therupon, that Pope Clement eſteemed King Henry to haue authority to commaund, what should be iudged, and ſpoken of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Certes S. Leo his words import no more, but that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour would not in any ſort fauour, or ſtrengthen the wicked decree of Dioſcorus and his complices, and therby make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf partaker of their ſinne (as he ſaith) knowing right well (as none of common ſenſe can be ignorant) how much force the fauour of the Prince hath, for maintaining either of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique truth, or for the bolſtering of the contrary, though he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not any deciding power therin. And that S. Leo did not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe vnto the Emperour any deciſiue, much leſſe ſupreame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in that matter, it is manifeſt by the ſame epiſtle. For firſt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:23816:120"/> he requeſteth a ſuſpenſion, of the decree of the falſe Epheſine councell, only vntill a greater number of Bishops through the whole church, should be called together in councell, that might determine that controuerſie: wherby it is more then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that S. Leo attributed the power to iudge that matter, to the paſtors of the church, and not to the Emperour.</p>
               <p>Secondly Flauianus who was wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfully depoſed by the pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Lioſcorus (as M. Maſon well ſaith) appealing from that ſentence, deliuered his appeale into the hands of the Popes Legates, as to the Lieutenants of his ſupreame iudge, and did not addreſſe himſelf to the Emperour, which he would not haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, if he had eſteemed him ſupreme iudge in his cauſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly Theodoſius himſelfe diſclaimeth not only from ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power in Eccleſiaſticall matters, but from all power the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, ſaying: <hi>It is not lawfull for me being no Bishop, to meddle with the deciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. ad Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. Epheſin.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And here I will put M. Maſon in mind of one thing, which he noteth well againſt his owne hereſie, which is, that as befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the ſpringing vp of the Eutichian hereſie, all men held the truth of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Sauiours two diſtinct natures in one perſon, ſo alſo before the ſpringing vp of the Lutheran hereſie, all men held the truth in all thoſe points, wherin he and his differeth from the ſame: and conſequently as Euthices was to be called backe to that faith, which was in the church before his hereſie ſprang vp, ſo are likewiſe the Lutherans, and all their progeny. But he prooueth by another epiſtle of S. Leo to Marcian the Emperors ſupremacy. S. Leo ſaith thus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſecond councell of Epheſus, which apparantly ſubuerted the faith.</hi>

Leo, as M. Maſon relateth his words. Whervpon he ſaith. <hi>Here the Pope aſcribeth to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:23816:121"/> power to ratify, and eſtablish thoſe councells, that they call not the truth of God in queſtion. Which the Emperour Marcians preactiſed, entring the councell of Chalcedon in his owne perſon, and forbidding the Bishops to auouch any thing, concerning the birth of our Sauiour, otherwiſe then was contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Nicene creed.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Pope Leo wrote thus againe to the Emperour. Becauſe I must by all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes obay your piety, and most religious will, I haue willingly giuen my conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſentence to theſe Synodicall conſtitutions, which concerning the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Catholique faith, and condemnation of heretiques pleaſed me very well. The Emperour required the Pope to ſubſcribe, and he did ſo cheerfully, proteſting that for his part, he must by all meanes obey the Princes will in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe caſes. Now tell me, whether the Pope did not acknowledge the Emperour, and the Emperour show himſelfe to be ſupreame Gouernour ouer all perſons, euen in cauſes eccleſiasticall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither thone nor thother can be probably gathered, much leſſe clearly prooued out of theſe teſtimonies. For the firſt is only a fatherly, or paſtorlie admonition to the Emperour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting him in ſweete manner to maintaine the decreeſe, of the paſtors of Gods church, which as a Catholique Prince he was bound to doe, and which he practiſed preciſely, according to the Popes direction, and not as hauing ſupreame power therin, forbidding that any thing should be affirmed, of the birth of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>otherwiſe then was conteined in the Nicene councell, and in the epiſtle of the most holy Bishop of Rome S.

               <p>The ſecond allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as litle to the purpoſe: for theſe words <hi>becauſe I muſt by all meanes obay your piety, and religious will</hi> (wherin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the force of M. Maſons illation) do not import any bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or obligation of duty, which the Pope had to the Emperour in that matter, as an inferiour to his ſuperiour, but a prompt and readie fulfilling of his reaſonable, and religious requeſt, as eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeareth by the Epiſtle following, written at the ſame time, and of the ſame matter to Pulcheria the Empreſſe, where the Pope writeth thus. <hi>And for as much as the moſt Godly Emperour would, that I should write to all the Bishops, that were preſent in the councell of Chalcedon, wherby I might confirme the things, that were defined there
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:23816:121"/> touching the rule of faith, I willingly performed it: leaſt the crafty diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome should make my iudgment doubtfull.</hi> Where M. Maſon may ſee, that the Emperour did not deſire the Pope, to ſubſcribe to the councell, as other Bishops had done, but to confirme that, which they had decreed, neither did he commaund him to do it, but willed him only, as a thing profitable, and conuenient, to make cleare his opinion in thoſe points, which ſome craftily would haue called into doubt, as the Pope himſelfe in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words declareth.

               <p>But if M. Maſon ſtand yet in doubt of S.

Neither will I repeate all he ſaith to this purpoſe in the whole 8. generall councell, for that would be ouer tedious, I will therfore relate only a few periods of his ſpeach, made in the end of the councell.

For to ſearch and ſeeke out theſe matters, belongeth to Patriarches, Bishops, and Prieſts, which are gouernours by office: who haue power to ſanctifie, to bind, and to looſe: who haue the keies of heauen, and of the church. It belongeth not vnto vs, who ought to be fedd, who haue neede to be ſanctified, to be bound, and to be looſed from bonds. For of whatſoeuer religion, or wiſdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the lay man be, yea though indewed with all internall vertues, ſo long as he is a lay man, he shall not ceaſe to be called a sheepe.

VVhat then haue we to doe being yet sheepe? The Pastors haue power to diſcuſſe the ſubtilty of words, and to ſeeke and find out ſuch things as are aboue vs. VVe muſt therfore in feare, and ſincere faith harken vnto them, and reuerence their contenances, as being the miniſters of almighty God, and bearing his forme: and not ſeeke any more then that, which belongeth to our degree and vocation.</hi> Thus farre the Emperour Baſill.</p>

               <p>You bring not one inſtance of any good King, commaunding by his Kinglie power any thing pertaining to religion, which was new, doubtfull, or in controuerſie, but only to execute ſuch things, as were euident by the law, according to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and practiſe of the church in thoſe times; As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that the Prieſts and Leuits should inſtruct the people, offer ſacrifice, ſing in the church, purge the temple of things pertaining, to the worship of falſe Gods, and the like: which, or the like things are practiſed by Chriſtian Kings, not only without blame, but with greateſt praiſe.

In which ſenſe it is euidentlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, out of this authoritie of S. Paul, that temporall Princes are not ſupreame heads, or gouernors of the church, by this argument.</p>
               <p>The Princes, whom S.

               <p>Yeu do not ſatisfie M. Maſon. For you giue no rule, nor can you giue any, how to know, when the King in matter of doubt, and controuerſie commaundeth for God, or for the truth, and when he commaundeth againſt God, and the truth. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the King of England forbiddeth in his kingdome the Maſſe, and all other rites and articles of religion, wherin the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes differ from the Catholiques: the King of France comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undeth, and alloweth them all in his kingdome. I would now vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of you M. Maſon, how either English or French men may in your doctrine know, whether of theſe two Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth for God and the truth, and whether of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth againſt God and the truth. For ſeeing they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund contrarie things, thone of them at leaſt muſt neceſſarilie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund againſt God or how he knoweth that K. Henry the 8. commaundeth againſt God and ther truth in commaunding the obſeruance of the ſix articles. So directly oppoſit to their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but for the truth when he commaunded himſelf to be called ſupream head of the church contrarie to all Catholique doctrin. You will I doubt not according to your accuſtomed manner, recurre to the written word and ſay, that he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth according to the word, commaundeth for God and the truth. But this is but loſſe of time, for we are no nearer to know the truth then before; the queſtion and doubt yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whether of theſe Kings commaunde according to the written word, which how to know I would Learne ſome rule of you. For ſeeing that in your doctrine, they are both ſupreame gouernors in theſe matters, within their owne dominions, and both of them prentend to commaund according to Gods word, it ſeemeth to me, that in your doctrine both their ſubiects are bound to obay them, and yet this is manifeſtlie abſurd, ſeeing that thone of them at the leaſt commaundeth againſt God and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:23816:126"/> his truth. I will attend your ſatisfaction M. Maſon in this point, which vntill you giue, I shall promiſe you to eſteeme your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of the ſupremacie of temporall Princes in ſpirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not only an hereſie in matter of faith, but an abſurd Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox euen in politike principles, as diuiding Princes one from thother in religion, wherin they ought moſt to agree, and tying their ſubiects either to obay them in matters hurtfull to their ſoules, or for feare of that to diſobay them, in matters pertaining to their duty: And to giue them power to iudg when their Prince commaundeth for God or againſt God and therby to open the dore to all rebellion and ſedition.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The ſecond obiection M. Maſon propoſeth in this ſort. <hi>If the ſupreame gouernment in ſpirituall cauſes be due to the imperiall crowne, it skilleth not, whether the Prince be man or woman, woman or child, nor of what religion. For the princely power was no leſſe in Traiane, then in Theodoſius, in King Henry, then Q. Mary, in Queene Mary the enemy of the new Goſpellers, then in Q. Elizabeth their protectrix: Yea it was no leſſe in King Lucius before he was baptiſed, then after. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Emperour of the Turkes may be called ſupreame gouernour, in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall within his owne dominions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The force of this argument would more euidentlie appeare, if M. Maſon had thus propoſed it <hi>If it belong to the Imperiall crowne, to be ſupreame gouernor of the church of Chriſt, euen in ſpirituall cauſes, it will neceſſarily follow, that Turkish and Pagan princes are ſo alſo. But this is very falſe and abſurd. For no man can be head of that body, wherof he is not a member: But Turkes and Pagans are not members of Chriſt his church, as is euident; they therfore cannot be heads, nor ſupreame gouernours therof in theſe cauſe, which, as it is Chriſts church, doth appertaine vnto it.</hi> But let vs ſee his anſwere to it, as it is propoſed by himſelfe.</p>

He that gaue it to Marke, gaue it to Ceſar, he that gaue it to Auguſtus, gaue it to Nero: he that gaue it to Veſpaſian father, or his ſonne moſt ſweet Emperours, gaue it alſo to Domitian the moſt cruell.

But though domination, and power were from the law of nature, yet the right vſe of it is not from nature, but from grace. A Prince as a Prince be he good or bad, in reſpect of princely calling hath ſufficient power, and authority to gouerne his people, according to the will of God. And it is his duty ſo to doe. The Lord ſaid vnto Cyrus. I will go before thee, and make the crooked ſtreight. I will breake the brazen doores, and burſt the iron barres.

So it is their duty to ſerue God, not only as they are men, but as they are Kings.

               <p>I confeſſe it was very irkſome vnto me, to make relation of all this longe and looſe diſcourſe, containing nothing to the purpoſe for the matter in hand. For the moſt that is here ſaid, is that Kings as Kings, haue power to make lawes for the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Chriſt, which is not denied (ſuppoſing they do it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the iudgment, of the paſtors of Gods church.) But this is Farre from that, which M. Maſon hath here to shew, which is to prooue that Kings as Kings, and therfore aſwell Pagan and infidell, as Chriſtian Kings, haue ſupreme and ſoueraigne authority, in eccleſiaſticall and Spirituall matters and cauſes. A propoſition, which (as I thinke) hath no author but M Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor any other ground but his fancy, ſtraitened by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the obiection, made againſt his doctrine of the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of temporall Princes, which he, finding no other meane to maintaine, is forced to ſett abroach this palpable abſurdity. When M. Maſon shall haue prooued this paradox, of the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power of Pagan Princes ouer Chriſts church, by ſome other ground then his owne ſenſeles aſſertion, we will diſpute with him, whether the diſtinction of the power it ſelfe, and the meanes to exerciſe it, be appliable to that purpoſe, for which he vſeth it, or no.</p>
               <p>In the meane while I will let him ſee, how dangerous this his doctrine, and diſtinction is to all eſtates, and how it openeth the waie to all ſedition. For by it maie he, or anie other, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe to be King of England, or anie other Kingdome, Saying that as he is the ſonne of his Father (be he whom he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:23816:128"/> will (he hath power from God to gouerne the Kingdome, and wanteth only hability to exerciſe that power, and to rule as King, and therfore if he should now begin to raigne, he should not do it by vertue of anie new power graunted him, but by vertue of the ſame power he had before. If he, or anie man els should argue in this ſort, he would (I doubt not) be quicklie lodged in the place appointed for crackt wits, till he should grow more wiſe. The fault that M. Maſon would find in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will let him ſee the like in his owne, that he may me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, if he will.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing he giueth vs no kind of proofe of this new para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe: that Pagan Princes haue ſoueraigne authority ouer Chriſts church, in Spirituall matters, and want only meanes to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te it, but will haue vs to beleeue it vpon his bare word, though he exact of vs,<note place="margin">we builde not our ſaith vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Popes, coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cels, nor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the ſacred Word of God regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in the writings of the Apostles and Prophets ſaith he pa. <hi>101.</hi> Cap <hi>15.</hi> n. <hi>7. 1.</hi> Cor. <hi>5.12.</hi>

Seeing (I ſay) he will giue vs no proofe for this his aſſertion, I will (to the proofes of the contrary before alleadged, aſwell out of ſcripture, antiquity, and reaſon) add one other deduced out of the doctrine of S. Paul, who ſaith expreſly, <hi>that he hath no power to iudge of thoſe, that are without (that is) that are not any way wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin the church, which is the houſe of God, and body of Chriſt.</hi> Whervpon it followeth and by greater reaſon, that thoſe that are without the church, as all Pagans euidently are, haue no power to iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, either thoſe perſons or cauſes, that are within the church. But M. Maſon to make his new doctrine more currant expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth the ſame in this ſort.<note place="margin">Mala. <hi>2.7.</hi> How he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth againſt him ſelf?

               </p>

                  <hi>The truth of this anſwere, that thou maist ſee in another glaſſe, let vs a litle remooue our ſpeech from the Prince to the prieſt: I demaund therfore if the Prieſts, the ſons of Aaron were not the meſſengers of the Lord of hastes. Yes verely as ſaith Malachy. But he may be a falſe prophet, an idolater, an Apostata, he may turne Pagan, or Atheist. Is ſuch a Prieſt the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſtes? A prieſt as a prieſt, be he good or bad, in reſpect of his prieſtly calling, and authority, is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſtes: he ought to leaue his impieties in ſeducing the people, and to ſerue God in teaching the truth. In that he is a prieſt, God hath armed him with a calling to deliuer his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:23816:128"/> meſsage, for performance wherof, he needeth no new calling, but grace to vſe that well, which before he abuſed. Apply this to the preſent point, and it will ſatisfie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good God, how blind and peruerſe is hereſie, which being to maintaine it ſelf without the grounds of Catholique doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, doth notwithſtanding obſtinately impugne the ſame?

                  <note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.27.</note>The argument in briefe is this. <hi>King Salomon depoſed Abiather being high prieſt, and put another in his place. Therfore Q. Elizabeth might do the like by the Bishops of her kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherunto I anſwere, that though it should be graunted, that Salomon as King only and not as a prophet and therefore by
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23816:129"/> ſpeciall reuelation depoſed Abiather: and Farther that his fact was iuſt, and lawfull (which two things M. Maſon cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely prooue) yet doth not this argument conclude any thing for M. Maſons purpoſe. For though it were alſo graunted, that the prieſts of the old law were ſubiect, in all temporall cauſes to the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their Kings, yet it doth not follow therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the prieſt of the new law are in like manner ſubiect to their Kings. For noe true Chriſtian can deny, but that the preieſthood of the new lawe, is both different, and alſo more perfect, then that of the old, whereas the power of the Kings is the ſame in both. And this is more then ſufficient, to hinder the neceſſary ſequell of the argument propoſed, in the iudgment of any one that hath anie iudgment.</p>
               <p>But yet Farther, be it that the prieſts of the new, and old law are equall in this reſpect, (which M. Maſon will neuer be able to prooue) yet doth M. Maſons argument conclude nothing at all for his purpoſe. For Abiathers caſe was farre different from that of our Catholique Bishops his cauſe being meerely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to wit his conſpiring againſt Salomon in fauour of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Adonias, which cauſe had it not bene in the perſon of a prieſt, should without all queſtion haue belonged to the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall tribunall to be iudged. But theirs was a matter of faith, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which though it had not bene in the perſon of prieſts, yet could it not haue bene iudged by a temporall iudge. And ſo M. Maſons maine argument is shewed to be moſt impertinent for his purpoſe, yea it may be retorted againſt him in this ſort. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Salomon, nor any other good King euer iudged, the prieſts of the old law in matters of faith and religion, but were ſubiect to their iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therin, as is manifeſt by the example of Saul and Ozias: therfore much leſſe can temporall Kings iudge, the prieſts of the new law in the like matters. Aand this whole matter I will prooue by the ineuitable teſtimony of his Maieſty, to whoſe authority M.

               <p>I Comprehend all thoſe that ſucceeded M. Parker, and the reſt that were firſt intruded into the places of the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Bishops, euen till this daie in one queſtion, becauſe their caſe is not different. Wherin it is cleare, that the ſame defects, which haue bene found in any of their predeceſſors ſince M. Cranmer (except that of intruſion ſpecified in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter going before) are alſo in the ſame degree in theſe, of whom the preſent queſtion is propoſed: and therfore the difficultie here is not of thoſe defects: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not ſome other in theſe, which was not in thothers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The reſolution is, that they haue a defect ſo eſſentiall, or materiall (more then thothers had) that it alone is ſufficient to make them no Bishops. And this is that they were not, or are not prieſts. So that their calling is defectiue, not only in reſpect of the callers, and calling; as that of the others was, but alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the perſons.</p>
               <p>That preieſthood is neceſſarily,<note place="margin">No man can be Bishop, that is high priest vnles he be prieſt.</note> and eſſentially preſuppoſed to epiſcopall order, and power in ſuch ſort, as he that is not prieſt cannot be Bishop, I find it not doubted of by anie of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, neither can there be any doubt therof. For it is no where found either in holy ſcripture, or eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, that any one was Bishop, that was not alſo prieſt, and therfore Bishops are ordinarily called prieſts, becauſe all Bishops are indeed prieſts; though all prieſts be not Bishops, as hath bene shewed before.</p>
               <p>The Catholique councell of Sardis doth admire and withall condemne the impudency of the Arrians, accuſors of S. Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, for vſing the teſtimonie of one as a Bishop, who was not ſo much as a prieſt. <hi>They gaue to him</hi> (ſaith the councell)

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The state of the question.</note>This ground therfore being agreed vpon by all parties: the preſent controuerſie reſteth in this only point: Whether the preieſthood of the new law doth include in it the power to offer ſacrifice vnto God, not only of praier, praiſe, or trankeſgiuing. but a true, proper, and externall ſacrifice, as the prieſts of the old law, or rather as our ſauiour Chriſt offered to his Father, or no. If it be prooued, that the prieſthood of the new law eſſentially includeth in it ſuch a power, it will inuincibly follow, firſt, that the new mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the pretended reformation, as well in England, as elſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That this diſputation maie proceede with ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I will firſt prooue by the teſtimonie of holy ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, interpreted by the Fathers of the firſt fiue hundreth yeares, that there is in the church of Chriſt a ſacrificing prieſthood, or a power to offer externall, and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſacrifice to God, no leſſe trulie and properly, then in the law of Moiſes. Secondly, I will anſwere the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt obiections againſt the ſame. Thirdlie, I will inferr therupon that, which is chieflie intended in this diſpute. In the firſt point I will not multiplie manie teſtimonies of holie ſcriptures, but will bring only two, or three at the moſt, with the ancient Fathers interpretations, which shalbe ſufficient to perſuade anie vnderſtanding not wilfullid tied to his owne errour, of which Kinde of

Which I prooue in this ſort. Our Sauiour Chriſt was Prieſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of Melchiſedech,<note place="margin">

But vnles he ſacrificed in his laſt ſupper, when he gaue his body and bloud to his diſciples, vnder the forme of bread and wine, he neuer ſacrificed in that forme and rite, that Melchiſedech ſacrificed in, (for his ſacrifice was in bread, and wine) Therfore is it neceſſarie that he then did truly ſacrifice. The whole difficultie of this argument is reduced to this point; whether Melchiſedech offered in bread and wine, as the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier offering of his order and prieſthood, or no: for this being prooued, the reſt is cleare.</p>
               <p>And that the proper, and peculiar offering of Melchiſedech his priſthood, was in bread and wine: no man that beleeueth the holy ſcriptures, interpreted by vncorrupt antiquitie, can make doubt.<note place="margin">

               <p>Be it ſo; what repugnance hath any part of all this, with Melchiſedech his offering of bread, and wine to God in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that M.

The cuſtome and manner aſwell of Iewes as Gentiles, feaſting and banquetting with the ſame meate that was offered in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, (wherof I ſuppoſe M. Maſon is not ignorant) doth
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:23816:134"/> shew, that there is no repugnance betwixt Melchiſedech his offering to God of bread and wine in ſacrifice, and his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining, feaſting, or refreshing Abraham, and his armie with the ſame. And that the feaſting or entertainment, which Melchiſedech made to Abraham, was not of meere frindship or hoſpitalitie, but a ſanctified and holy feaſt, it is plaine euen by Ioſephus the Iew, whom M. Maſon citeth, who ſaith that <hi>Melchiſedech made vnto Abraham a holy banquet,</hi> as the Greeke word will without any force beare. But ſeeing M. Maſon maketh force of a Iewes authoritie, againſt the moſt auncient Chriſtian Doctors, in a matter pertaining to Gods worship, and true ſenſe or vnderſtanding of holy ſcripture (which to any good Chriſtian may ſeeme iuſtly abſurd) I will remit him in this point to Philo the Iew, who was not only Ioſephus his auncient, but alſo eſteemed of more authoritie by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, aſwell for his iudgment, and learning, as for his ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in his religion.

                  <hi>and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Bishop of God most mighty ſaw Abraham returned in ſafety, with victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his company all whole, (for he had loſt neuer a man) admiring the great proſperous ſucceſſe, and thinking (as it was true) that by Gods ſpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and helpe, he had caried himſelf ſo proſperouſly, holding vp his hands to heauen bleſſed him, and ſacrificed a victorius banquet, and richly feaſted all his company.</hi> Wherby M. Maſon may learne, that Melchiſedech his banquet prepared for Abraham was not a prophane feaſt, or a meere ciuill entertainment, but ſuch a religious banquet, as was wont to be made both by Iewes and Gentiles, in ſuch occaſions of ioy, and exultation, accompanied with ſacrifice to God. And therfore without all shew of reaſon doth he deny, that Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech offered ſacrifice of bread and wine, ſeeing ſo many, and ſo graue fathers do in moſt expreſſe words teſtifie the ſame, and no one good authour doth deny, or contradict it.</p>
               <p>Farther M. Maſon dealeth moſt iniuriouſlie with his authors. For both S. Ambroſe and Andradius in the very ſame places by himſelfe cited, do moſt expreſlie teach Melchiſedech his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which M. Maſon ſo peremptorilie denieth.

               </p>
               <p>Andradius diſputing with Kemnitius hath a large and learned diſcourſe, wherin he maintaineth againſt his aduerſary, the truth of the vulgar Latine tranſlation: reading the text of Geneſis thus: <hi>Melchiſedech bringing forth bread and wine for he was prieſt of the moſt high God:</hi> and therby proouing the Catholique doctrine of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Euchariſt, doth moſt expreſly mention the ſacrifice of Melchiſedech in bread and wine. Thou maiſt ſee him if thou pleaſe diligent reader, and deteſt M. Maſons bad dealing with him.

                  <hi>As in other things Melchiſedech bare the perſon of Chriſt, ſo did he repreſent his prieſthood, in that he firſt after the accuſtomed manner, offered to God as to the author of a moſt glorious victoire, the bread and wine, which he gaue for the nourishing of Abraham his army.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>The vulgar tranſlation, which you follow is erroneours: for according to the Hebrew it is not (for he was a prieſt) but (and he was a prieſt) as Arius Montanus tranſlateth it, and Ballarmine confeſſeth.

Eſpecially hauing ſeene this ſelf ſame obiection made before by Kemnitius, ſo fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by Andradius, in the place by himſelf alleaged, as he neither can, nor dare ſaie anie thing againſt it, but wittinglie diſſembling the anſwere, wilfully repeateth the obiection, as though it had neuer bene anſwered. Is this ſincere dealing, and worthie a reformer of Gods church? Not hauing much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this shift, he thinketh to elude the force of this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, another waie and ſaith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Melchiſedech gaue entertainment to Abraham, moued therunto by conſideration of his owne office, euen becauſe he was not only a profeſſour of the true religion, but alſo a priest; For as it becometh all that embrace religion, to loue one another, and reioice at their good, ſo this duty ſpecially belongeth to the prieſt. And your learned Ieſuite Andradius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The learned Andradius was no Ieſuit.</note> 
                  <hi>hence obſerueth the great linke of religion. Therfore is there no neceſsity to ſaie, that he ſacrificed bread and wine: for the text, euen read and pointed as you would haue it, maie in the iudgment of ſome of your learned diuines, admit an excellent ſenſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is wholly beſides the purpoſe. For firſt Melchiſedech is not ſaid to haue ſacrificed in bread and wime, becauſe there appeareth no other occaſion, why he should bring forth bread and wine to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only to ſacrifice: for none that I know euer dreamed of ſuch a reaſon. But becauſe the ſcripture inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:23816:136"/> by the Doctors, and Paſtors of Gods church, to whom he hath giuen the keie of knowledge, to interprete his law vnto his people, doth teach, that he did ſacrifice in bread and wine, when he mett Abraham. Secondly, the words of the ſcripture as they haue euer bene read, ſince they were turned into Latine, cannot haue anie conuenient, or probable ſenſe, without his Sacrifice be vnderſtood. For though the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the true religion might be a motiue, why Melchiſedech should reioice at Abrahams victorie, and conſequently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him with a ciuill, and friendly banquett, yet the holie Ghoſt giuing for the reaſon of his bringing out of bread and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, <hi>that he was the priest of God,</hi> muſt in anie reaſonable mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding be thought to expreſſe ſomething done by Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech, bringing forth bread and wine that was proper only to a prieſt to do which could be nothing but Sacrifice. For the other frindly entertainment beſeemed him rather as a King, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with Abraham in the worship of the true God, then as a prieſt. And therfore if there had bene no other matter in Melchiſedech his bringing forth of bread and wine, then a frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly act of Hoſpitalitie, the holie Ghoſt giuing the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof would doubtles haue ſaid. <hi>For he was King of that country;</hi> and not: <hi>for he was prieſt of God moſt high.</hi> Againe ſeeing the linke of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as M. Maſon ſaith (after Andradius) might mooue Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech to congratulate with Abraham a ſtraunger for his victory, and to entertaine him with a ciuill banquett, rather then to condole with his neighbour Kings for their ouerthrow: the ſame linke of religion might with greater reaſon alſo mooue him being a prieſt, to offer to God Sacrifice of thankeſgiuing for his victory, and to receiue him with a religious, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied feaſt, eſpecially the ancient cuſtome being, that ſolemne banquets were neuer made, without ſacrificing firſt to God. Neither doth Andradius admitt anie probable ſenſe of thoſe words of Geneſis, wherin Sacrifice is not expreſſed, as M. Maſon falſly fathereth vpon him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. M. Maſon cometh now to caſt his shott anker, and ſaith. <hi>Though it be imagined, that Melchiſedech offered bread and wine, yet will it be nothing to our purpoſe. For our Sauiour Chriſt neuer offered bread and wine in our doctrine, but his body and bloud, and therfore from Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech his offering of bread, and wine, can we inferre nothing for the proofe of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:23816:136"/> that ſacrificing prieſthood, which we pretend to haue bene instituted by our Sauiour Chriſt in his last ſupper.</hi> This is the full ſenſe of that he would ſaie, for his words are too many, and too empty of matter, to make rehearſall therof all at large.</p>
               <p>This meane obiection which is M. Iewells, or M. Hoopers, S. Cyprian preuented, and anſwered 1300. yeares agoe and more. And therfore my labour in anſwering the ſame, shalbe only to relate his words: that if M. Maſon diſdaine to learne his faith, of the preſent Catholique church, yet he maie not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to learne it of the ſame church, teaching the ſame doctrine in S. Cyprians daies. Thus therfore writeth that ancient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and glorious martyr. <hi>Who is rather the prieſt of the moſt high God, then our lord</hi> Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>who offered ſacrifice to God the Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. ad Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilianum.</note> 
                  <hi>and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame thing that Melchiſedech offered, that is, bread and wine, to wit, his body and bloud?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How can it be, will M. Maſon aske, that our Sauiour Chriſt offered his body and bloud, as S. Cyprian with the Catholique church doth teach, and yet offered the ſame thing which Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech offered, who offered only bread and wine? This que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in M. Maſons beliefe, or rather misbeliefe, is not eaſily anſwered, but in S. Cyprians doctrine, which is that of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique church, it hath ſmall difficulty. For S. Cyprian doth in the ſame place explicate, how both theſe are true, of whom if M. Maſon will learne, he will find this hard queſtion eaſilie, and clearely ſolued. Thus he writeth. <hi>Therfore that the bleſsing of Abraham in Geneſis might be rightly performed by Melchiſedech the prieſt, the image of Christs ſacrifice conſtituted in bread and wine went before, which thing our lord perfecting, and fulfilling offered bread and the chalice mixt with wine, and he which is the fulnes (or perfection) did fulfill the truth of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured image.</hi> So that the cleare doctrine of this holy Father is, that our Sauiour Chriſt, who was prefigured by Melchiſedech, offered his bodie and bloud, the truth or thing it ſelfe of that, wherof Melchiſedech offered the figure in bread and wine, and therfore maie truly be ſaid to haue offered the ſame thing, that Melchiſedech did. Which is alſo in another reſpect, to wit, in that the ſacrifice of our Sauiour Chriſt did not differ in externall forme and appearance, from that of Melchiſedech, both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being in forme of bread and wine, which is a ſufficient reaſon, why our Sauiour may be ſaid to haue offered in bread and wine,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:23816:137"/> though not in ſubſtance of bread and wine. For it is no vnuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall matter in holy ſcripture,<note place="margin">

               <p n="7">7. Hauing thus shewed (ſufficientlie as I ſuppoſe) all M.

Wherin he will make the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier prieſthood of Melchiſedech to ſtand? which queſtion is neither impertinent, nor vnprofitable. For ſeeing it is euident firſt, that he was a prieſt. Secondly, that he was prieſt of an order diſtinct from that of Aaron, and peculier to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that our Sauiour Chriſt was prieſt of his order. Fourthly, that it ought chiefly to be honored of all Chriſtians, as appeareth as well by that, that God himſelfe would ſo highly honour it, as to make his owne only ſonne prieſt of that order for our ſakes, and therby obliged vs peculiarly, to honour both him and his prieſthood, as alſo by the high, and maieſticall ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, wherwith the holy ghoſt doth proclaime his order in this manner,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Our lord hath ſworne, and it shall not repent him; thou art a priest for euer according to the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> All this I ſaie being euident, it is moſt neceſſary for vs to know, wherin this highly honoured prieſthood doth conſiſt, which I would learne of M. Maſon. But vnles he can shew out of holy ſcripture ſome particularitie, proper onlie to this order, (which ſeeing he reiecteth the Sacrifice of bread and wine, he is no more able to performe, then to pull the ſunne out of heauen with his fingers) he can neuer ſatisfie this demaund. For three things only are mentioned in holy ſcripture, which Melchiſedech did as prieſt: Firſt that he brought forth bread and wine.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 14.</note> Secondly, that he bleſſed Abraham.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that he tooke tithes of him, wherof the two laſt are common to the prieſthood of Aaron,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numbers.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 7.5.</note> as is manifeſt by the places cited in the margent, ſo the firſt only remaineth as proper to Melchiſedech.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:23816:137"/>
               <p>Are not our new maiſters more then peruerſe, to forſake in a matter of principall moment, the teſtimony of holy ſcripture, interpreted by ſo manie faithfull, and vnpartiall paſtors, and to grope after vncertaine fancies, and vaine coniectures of their owne wauering, and wandring braine? But ſuch is the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent malice of hereſie, that it eſteemeth not into what euident abſurdities it falleth ſo that the Catholique truth maie be obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and drawne into queſtion. When M. Maſon shall ſet downe out of holy ſcripture, the proper function of Melchiſedech his order, that therby we maie come to know the high prieſthood of our Sauiour Chriſt, ſo extraordinarily eſtablished by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable oath of his eternall Father, and shall prooue it as firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as his Sacrificing of bread and wine is prooued, he shall ſaie ſomething to the purpoſe; till then he muſt not thinke much, if following his owne ſinguler fancies, he be eſteemed, as all other ſectaries are, a ſeducer of Gods people. Vnles he thinke better, as it is indeede, to turne backe, and follow the trodde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> path of Gods Catholique church. And that I ſaie to M.

               <p n="8">8. He cometh next to declare the eternity, or continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our Sauiour his prieſthood, wherin though he do fowly erre as he doth in other points, yet becauſe mine intent is not to handle here all matters of controuerſie, but onlie ſuch as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the proouing of a Sacrificing prieſthood in the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall law, which is prooued by the prieſthood it ſelfe of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech (as we shall ſee in the end) without diſputing this pointt of the eternitie of our Sauiour prieſthood, though by this it be alſo prooued, I will not ſtand here to refute his errour tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſame. But I will only bring one authority of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retus for this purpoſe, which I make not choice of amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of the ancient Fathers, becauſe I eſteeme it the moſt formall of all others, but becauſe it is brought by M. Fulke for the contrary end; Yet do I not ſo much intend hereby to taxe M. Fulke of want of iudgment, in bringing a teſtimony ſo clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely againſt himſelfe, as therby to shew the pouerty of the cauſe he would maintaine, ſeeing it is forced to ſeeke ſupport from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that beare teſtimony againſt it, and the force of truth. Which he would impugne, which is ſo euidently ſtrengthened by the

Pſalme, as M. Fulke relateth them. <hi>Chriſt is now a prieſt, which is ſprung of Iuda according to the flesh, not offering any thing himſelfe, but is called the head of thoſe that offer, ſeeing he calleth the church his body, and therfore he exerciſeth the prieſthood as man, but he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thoſe things that are offered, as God. And the church offereth the tokens of his body and bloud, ſanctifying all the leauen by the firſt fruites.</hi> Theodoret ſaith here three things, out of which is manifeſtly concluded, the continuall exerciſe of Chriſt his prieſthood, to conſiſt in the viſible Sacrifice of the church, to wit the holy Euchariſt. Firſt he ſaith, that Chriſt is now a prieſt. Secondly, that though he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing himſelfe, yet is he the head of thoſe that offer, and conſequently doth offer by them. Thirdly that as man he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth euen now his prieſthood, to wit concurring as head with thoſe, that offer as his members or miniſters. Wherby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that in Theodorets doctrine, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall exerciſe of Chriſt his prieſthood conſiſteth in the viſible Sacrifice of the church. Which Sacrifice whether it be the true body and bloud of Chriſt, as the Catholique church teacheth and beleeueth, or no, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not to this place to examine, being a diſtinct queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, which we haue here in hand. Now to returne to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in hand of Melchiſedechs Sacrifice, M. Maſon confirmeth his doctrine touching the ſame in this ſort.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>The Apoſtle to the Hebrewes ſpeaking very particulerly of this ripe</hi> (of Melchiſedech in reſpect of Chriſt) <hi>ſaith not one word concerning his Sacrifice, but vnfoldeth it in theſe braunches following. Firſt that he was King of iuſtice. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly that he was King of peace. Thirdly that he was both King and prieſt. Fourthly that he bleſſed Abraham. Fiftly that he receiued titles of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Sixtly that he was without Father and nother. Seauenthly, that he had neither beginning of his daies, nor end of his life. Thus the ſcripture vnfoldeth the type of Melchiſedech, plentifully and particulerly and yet ſaith not one word concerning his ſacrificing, which is an euident argument, that it is a meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and imagination of mans braine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true that our Sauiour Chriſt was prefigured in all theſe things by Melchiſedech: but not only in theſe for he was alſo prefigured by him as prieſt as the holy ſcripture teſtifieth pſal. 109. And that the Apoſtle ſaith nothing of his (Melchiſedechs) Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice it is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſe. For in this 7. chapter to the Hebrewes, doth he inſiſt ſpecially in the inculcating of our Sauiours prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthood,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:23816:138"/> according to the order of Melchiſedech, as is cheefe drift in that chapter (as any man that will reade it shall plainlie ſee.) How can therfore any man (that is not blind either with malice, or ignorance) ſaie, that the ſcripture ſpeaketh not one word concerning Melchiſedechs Sacrifice, ſeeing prieſthood, and Sacrifice are no leſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioined together, then are fatherhood and generation? Tell me I praie you good Sir, if one should ſaie that M. Maſon is a husband or a Father, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie manner of other husbands and Fathers: should he ſaie nothing concerning thoſe actions, without which all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know you can neither be husband, nor Father? You will not I ſuppoſe denie, but that he should make ſuch mention of them, as that all men might vnderſtand them to be in you.</p>
               <p>How therfore can you ſo confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſaie, that S. Paul ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning Melchiſedechs Sacrifice, ſeeing he ſaith ſo much of his prieſthood? vnles peraduenture you can find out ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me prieſthood without Sacrifice, which was yet neuer heard of.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>There is not one word</hi> (ſaith M. Maſon) <hi>in the whole Bible to declare, that Melchiſedech was a type of Christ in offering ſuch vnbloudy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the formes of bread and wine; And this very ſilence is like the voice of a trumpet proclaiming vnto the world, that popery is the meere inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man, and shall wither in the roote from whence it ſprung.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your threating prophecies Sir, are hereticall vanities like tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of your Father Luther, who threatned to be the ruine of the Pope; But he is dead and rotten, and the Pope is where he was before he was borne, and ſo shall popery (as you ſcornfully tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the Catholique truth) be, when you and all your fellowes shalbe gone, to giue account of your hereſie, and rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt God and his church, with the reſt of all thoſe, that haue impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned the Catholique verity, euer ſince the firſt founding of the ſame.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, I do not greatly marueile, that you cannot find any word in the whole Bible, declaring Melchiſedechs Sacrifice in bread and wine, in figure of Chriſt vnbloudy Sacrifice. For neuer any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique could find any word in the Bible (or that which he tooke for the Bible) againſt his hereſie. Arrius could find nothing for the conſubſtantiality of the ſonne with the Father, nor Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:23816:139"/> or Macedonius, for the diuinity, or godhead of the holie Ghoſt; Neſtorius, Eutiches, Pelagius, and the reſt in like manner, could not find one word in holy ſcripture, for the proofe of the Catholique truth by them impugned. But what then? Shall we therfore ſaie, that the holy Bible contained no one word of all theſe truthes? M. Maſon I am ſure will not ſaie ſo. For though thoſe wretches blinded, with hereticall pride and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, could ſee nothing of all this in the holy ſcripture, yet the Catholique Paſtors, who defended againſt them the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique truth, did find them all contained therin, as alſo their Catholique ſucceſſours now do this truth, which M. Maſon here impugneth, whoſe iudgments if he will not yeeld vnto, as either ſuſpected of partialitie, and moued with paſſion againſt his errour: or that he eſteemeth his owne iudgment as good as theirs: yet if he haue either but any one ſparke of the light of reaſon, or dramme of modeſtie in him he cannot appeale from the iudgments, of thoſe great lights of the world, the Fathers of the primitiue church, againſt whom neither of theſe exceptions can be made, who found in holie ſcripture the Sacrifice of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech in bread and wine, in figure of Chriſts vnbloudy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as hath already bene shewed, and M. Maſon himſelfe is at laſt forced to confeſſe in theſe words.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>11. Firſt, <hi>Some of the Fathers ſay not, that Melchiſedech offered bread and wine to God, but to Abraham</hi> whoe are theſe Fathers? why are they not named? but be it ſo: this doth not for all that exclude the offering therof to God, but rather include it, as is already ſeene. Secondly, (ſaith he) <hi>thoſe which ſay it was offered vnto God as a Sacrifice</hi> (as all do that write either vpon the 14. cap. of Geneſis, or the pſalme 109 or by other occaſion handle this marter) <hi>may meane an Euchariſticall Sacrifice, and not a propitiatory.</hi> So may they meane both, as they doe in deede. <hi>Thirdly if any of the Fathers ſay, that he offered a propitiatory Sacrifice, yet it followeth not, that becauſe they make the oblation of Melchiſedech a type of the Euchariſt, that therfore in the Euchariſt, there is a propitiatory Sacrifice.</hi> And why Sir I praie you doth it not follow? If you conſider that the condition of a type, or figure is alwaies to be leſſe perfect, then the thing it ſelf which is figured by it, you will find it to follow <hi>a fortiori,</hi> or with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon.</p>

               <p>But you ſay, that <hi>thoſe which hold ſo</hi> (to wit that Melchiſedech offered a propitiatorie ſacrifice) <hi>muſt make a double oblation of this bread and wine, the firſt to God by way of ſacrifice: the ſecond to Abraham, and the army in the manner of a banquet: the firſt might haue relation to Chriſt vpon the craſſe: the ſecond to the Eucharist.</hi> There is no doubt, but the fathers vnderſtood this double oblation you ſpeake of, thone to God in ſacrifice, thother to Abraham and his armie for their refreshing but whether the firſt offering in the fathers meaning had relation to Chriſt vpon the croſſe, and not to him as offered vnder the forme of bread and wine in his laſt ſupper, the fathers cleare teſtimonies before alleaged for this purpoſe, yea and M. Caluin, and the Centuriſts ſayings hereafter cited, (whoſe authoritie I hope will ſway ſomething with you) shall witnes, you add.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, your popish maſsing ſacrifice preſuppoſeth tranſubſtantiation, which is contrary to Chriſts inſtitution of the Euchariſt, as in due place shalbe declared. VVherfore thoſe fathers, which vnderstand the Euchariſt according to Christs inſtitution, cannot referre the type of Melchiſedech to any tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiate ſacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You flinch M. Maſon, you flinch; what haue you here to do with tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Our queſtion was whether in the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the auncient fathers, there be any mention in holy ſcripture of Melchiſedech offering bread and wine, in figure of the ſacrifice of the Euchariſt. Why do you therfore run to the queſtion of tranſubſtantiation? I know the reaſon as well as if I were in your boſome. Your owne eies conuince you of the queſtion in hand, and becauſe your obſtinacie will not permit you to yeeld to the manifeſt truth, you run to that other queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which cannot orderly be ſpoken of, before thother be decided, as you ſaw your ſelf, when you deferd it to another place.</p>
               <p>But to let this paſſe, and to take that only, which victorious truth hath drawne from you, I wil only aske of you, what you thinke of the doctrine of thoſe fathers, who you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe to haue taught Melchiſedechs ſacrifice in bread and wine, (be it Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſticall or propitiatorie, it shall not much import for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) whether it be comformable to ſcripture or no? If you ſay no: you will not be beleeued of any man, that hath but one dra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of true iudgment. For who can imagine, that thoſe great lights,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:23816:140"/> and paſtors of Gods church, whoſe learning, pietie, and other excellent vertues beſeeming the paſtors of Gods church, haue made them venerable to all poſteritie: liuing many hundreth yeares before theſe controuerſies were hatched, and therfore voide of all paſſion and partialitie, were not more like to find out the true ſenſe and meaning of holy ſcripture, and alſo to deliuer it with more ſinceritie, then either you M.

               </p>
               <p>The Proteſtants do not deny, that this propheſie is fulfilled in the church of Chriſt: but they deny that this cleane oblation, which the Prophet here ſpeaketh of, is any ſenſible or proper ſacrifice, but a ſpirituall or inward oblation: vnto which miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable shift they are driuen by force. For if they should grant this cleane oblation here fortold to be a true, proper, and ſenſible ſacrifice, their pretended church should be conuinced to be a Synagogue of Satan, and not the true church of Chriſt, becauſe it hath no ſuch ſacrifice. But if there be any certaine meanes, to find out the true ſenſe and meaning of the holy ſcripture, either by the ſound of the words themſelues, or by the circumſtance of the place, or the vnderſtanding of the auncient church, or

And to make vp the meaſure of his malice, againſt Gods church and Chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he yet runneth on into more groſſe abſurdities. For to the third propertie of the ſacrifice mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Malachie, which was that it ſucceedeth thoſe of the Iewes, wheras the ſpirituall ſacrifices are ioined with all, and ſucceede none he ſaith.</p>

                  <hi>Though the ſpirituall ſacrifice of the Iewes and of the Chriſtians were all one in ſubſtance: yet they differed in manner, becauſe as I ſaid theirs were mixtly, ours meerely ſpirituall, and the merely ſucceed the mixed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">If the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Iewes were the ſame in ſubstance with thoſe of the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: they should alſo be the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with that of our Sauiour Chriſt which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is more then hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to affirm.</note>What other thing is this, then that in ſubſtance the Chriſtian religion and worship of God is the ſame with the Iewes, and differeth from it only in manner; and that in ſuch a manner, as that of the Iewes remaineth the more perfect, ſeeing it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſame perfection, that the Chriſtian religion doth, and ouer and beſides ſomething more? But M. Maſon thinketh he hath learnedly preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted this abſurdity in ſaying, <hi>that their ſacrifices were mixedly, and are meerely ſpirituall,</hi> wherby (as I ſuppoſe) he would ſay that ours are better, and more perfect then theirs, which yet is more ſenſeles then the reſt. For I would aske of him, whether by adding the externall, and corporall ſacrifices to the ſpirituall, theſe are made leſſe ſpirituall, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently leſſe perfect? He ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſay yea. For vnles we ſuppoſe, that this additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should change the nature of the ſpirituall ſacrifice (which M. Maſon will not haue, for he ſaith they are both of one ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be imagined, how the adding of the corporall, or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſacrifice may make the internall leſſe ſpirituall, or leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And he himſelfe will confeſſe the ſame in this example. If one should giue him a purſe with twentie pounds of gold in it, and another should giue him another with as much gold, and beſides with as many peeces of ſiluer more, I thinke not that he wold eſteeme the latter gift of leſſe valew, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other for the ſiluer added therunto, but of more worth. So in like manner no man of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t can eſteeme the ſpirituall ſacrifices of the Iewes,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:23816:142"/> (which M.

For if it were otherwaies, God hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to offer ſuch ſacrifices, should haue commaunded a thing both hurtfull to them, and diſpleaſing to himſelfe (as impayring and diminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing the valour, and worth of their ſpirituall ſacrifices) which is verie abſurd to imagine. The Iewes therfore haueing the ſame ſpirituall offerings that Chriſtians haue, as M. Maſon confeſſeth, and ouer and aboue other corporall ſacrifices commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and ordained by God himſelfe, (and therfore cannot be hurtfull to thother being good in themſelues) it muſt neceſſarilie follow, that in M. Maso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doctrine, the Iewes offerings and ſacrifices are more perfect, then thoſe of the Chriſtians, and conſequentlie their religion alſo and manner of Gods worshipe more perfect. So that M. Maſon, whilſt he wil be a Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this point, doth prooue himſelf more a Iew then a Chriſtian, and yet he goeth forward in moſt palpable abſurdities. For anſwering to the fourth propertie, which was that this ſacrifice ſpoken of by Malachie, is ſo cleane of it ſelfe, that it cannot be polluted by the prieſt that offereth it, be he neuer ſo wicked; wheras the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſacrifices, being our workes are ſtained, and vncleane in the Proteſtants iudgment: anſwering I ſay herunto, he verie wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie as he thinketh, retorteth the argument in this ſort.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Are all our ſpirituall offerings vncleane?</hi>

               <p>But moſt ignorantlie (by his good leaue be it ſpoken) doth he inferre theſe conſequences againſt the Catholiques, vpon an antecedent which is his owne only and none of theirs.

But we will firſt ſee, how M.

For thoſe he only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth: gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueing vs strengh to work, and leaueing vs in our liberty to vſe it as we will.</note> which teacheth that all our workes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God; or depend of him I anſwere that it is eaſily auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in true diuinitie, and Philoſophie, according to which our whole actions do proceed from God, or depend of him and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles the ſame whole actions proceed alſo from vs, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a diuers ſort and order. For from God they proceede as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt, vniuerſall, indeterminate, and independent ſource, or agent: from vs as from a ſecondarie, dependent, and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or determinate cauſe, from whence they take their nature, qualitie, valour and denomination: ſo that they are wholly good, or whollie bad, and not partie coloured, as M. Maſon would haue them. Which point becauſe it is ſomewhat nice, and ſubtill, and not eaſie to be vnderſtood of euerie one, I will make more plaine by this example. The actions or operations, wherby the fire bringeth forth heate or fire, an appletree bringeth forth an apple, a horſe begetteth a horſe, or a man a man, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of all other creatures whatſoeuer, do proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God as from the firſt and ſupreame cauſe, from the heauens or the ſun, as from an inferiour, or ſecondarie cauſe or argent (for without the cooperation of theſe cauſes, the inferiour agents can do nothing) and alſo from the fire, tree, horſe, man, or other creature, as from the loweſt, neereſt, and moſt immediate cauſe. And no action, or operation of theſe inferiour creatures is produced, but by the concurſe, and cooperation of all theſe agents not in part, as if one part were produced by God, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſun, and a third by the fire, or other creature, but euery one of theſe agents co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre to the producing of the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le action, but in his order and degree, and though all theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do concurre to euerie one of theſe actions, yet is it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:23816:144"/> actions of diuers natures, but one only action and of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or qualitie, and therfore that, which is brought forth by it is one onlie thing, for example heate, fire, apple, horſe, man or the like, and not partlie fire or apple, and partlie another thing.

               <p>And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the cooperation of the fire being determined to one effect, doth determine the concurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and cooperation of the ſuperiour agents, (which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are indifferent, and as fitt to bring forth any other thing as fire) to this determinate effect. The fire therfore or apple ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not the being, eſſence, or nature of fire or apple rather then anie other, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cooperation or concurrence of God, or the ſun, but from the fire or the tree, from whence they proceede immediatly, though they do as truly proceed from the ſun and from God, as they do from the fire and from the tree. So in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke manner our morall actions do take their whole nature, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and morall valour good or bad from vs, from whom they immediatlie proceede, and not from God: though they as truly proceede from him (foraſmuch as pertaineth to the ſubſtance of the action) as from vs. Therfore if they be according to the rule or preſcript of right reaſon (which is the meaſure of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions) they are good, honeſt, and laudable, not in part but in whole, though they proceede from man as well as from God, as an apple is an apple not in part but in whole, though it proceede as well from the ſun and from God, as from the tree. If they be not according to the preſcript of right reaſon, they are vitious, inhoneſt, and blameworthie, not in part but in the whole, though the whole ſubſtance of the action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from God as well as from man, becauſe the nature, and qualitie of the action is taken from the immediate agent, as is noted before. And Farther if they proceede not onlie from our free will guided by the light of nature, but alſo from the pure fountaine of heauenlie grace, they are not only morallie good
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:23816:145"/> and honeſt, but meritorious before God of the increaſe of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and glorie, not in part, but in whole. Falſe therfore and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous is M. Maſons imaginarie mixture of our workes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to diuers parts, wherof one should be good and another bad, one cleane and another vncleane.</p>
               <p>Thother abſurditie contained in M. Maſons former word is: <hi>that our workes are denominated of the worthier part.</hi> For though it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re true, as it is alreadie prooued to be moſt falſe, that our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes had two parts, thone cleane, thother vncleane (as M. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon neceſſarilie ſuppoſeth when he ſaith, that they are nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the worthier part) yet would it be falſe, and abſurd to ſay, that they take their nomination of the worthier part. For the contrary is moſt true, as appeareth by that euident rule of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re noted firſt by S. Dennis,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De diuini nominibus.</hi> Bonum ex integra cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, malum ex quocumque defectu. Dion.</note> and ſince receiued of all as well Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, as diuines, that <hi>that which is good is of a perfect cauſe, but euill is of euery particuler defect.</hi> So that, that worke, or action, which hath in it anie defect, is truly ſaid to be euill, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie all our workes being in part vncleane, (according to M. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doctrine) muſt needs be naught, and therfore cannot be that pure offering foretold by Malachie. And this is euident by the common iudgment of all men, who eſteeme a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bad, though they haue but one bad qualitie or condition, ſo wee ſaie a rotten apple or crackt veſſell, though the greateſt part therof be good and ſound: and we ſaie likewiſe a lame man and a tearne coate, though he want the vſe but of one hand or foote, or there be but one hole in the coate: By all which exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and a thouſand more it is euident, that M.

And therfore a man is ſaid to be a reaſonable creature in reſpect of his ſoule, which is the worthier part, and a horſe is ſaid to be a liuing, moouing, and ſenſible thing, for the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And betwixt thoſe things that are compoſed, or conſiſt to ſpeake as the vulgar ſort conceiueth) of one poſitiue, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther negatiue or priuatiue part, as a man may be ſaid to conſiſt of a whole, and a lame legg, an apple of a ſound and rotten ſide,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:23816:145"/> and the like. In all which the denomination alwaies followeth the defectiue part, for the reaſon giuen before out of S. Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis: and of this latter kind are our workes and actions, which when they want anie circumſtance, or perfection which is due vnto them, and which they ought to haue (as all our actions do in M. Maſons doctrine) are alwaies ſaid to be euill and naught; and therfore can in no ſort be ſaid to be that pure offering mentioned by the Prophet Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus refuted M. Maſons shifts, concerning the pure offering ſo often mentioned, I will now ſatisfie the obiection before inſinuated, which maie be framed out of the Catholique doctrine in fauor of M. Maſon in this ſort.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The good workes of a iuſt man proceeding from Gods grace are meritorious, ſatisfactorie, and iuſtificatiue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie are pure and cleane. Why therfore maie they not be that pure offering mentioned in the Prophet Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie?</p>
               <p>The anſwere is eaſie. For though a iuſt mans workes, which proceede from Gods grace, be pure and cleane, yet can they not be that pure offering, wherof the Prophet Malachie ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, for diuers reaſons, wherof ſome part are alreadie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Namelie for that the Sacrifice fortold by Malachie is a true and proper Sacrifice, wheras our good workes are but metaphoricallie, and vnproperly called a Sacrifice: that is but one; theſe are manie: that is proper to the church of the gentiles: theſe are common to the Iewes and genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. That ſucceedeth the Sacrifices of the Iewes: theſe are ioined with all Sacrifices, and ſucceede none. Therfore the holy ghoſt reproouing the prieſthood and Sacrifice of the Iewes in reſpect of that of the gentiles, it muſt needs be, that he ment ſome other Sacrifice, then all that which the Iewes offered: who notwithſtanding offered the ſame Spirituall Sacrifice of prayer, praiſe, and thanks giueing, that the Chriſtian ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles doe. For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwais the Sacrifice of the gentiles, if it were no other then of Praier, and praiſe cowld not be ſo preferred before that of the Iewes as that it showld be approoued by God, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All theſe reaſons are already touched, and shew manifeſtly, that our good workes although neuer ſo cleane, and pure, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not

               <p>Now do I appeale to thy iudgment, indifferent reader, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther M. Maſon (affirming this teſtimonie of the Prophet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie to be vnderſtood of ſpirituall offerings, by the iudgment of the fathers, and namelie of theſe two) doth not ſay either he careth not,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 219.</note> or knoweth not what? But let vs ſee, vpon what ground he affirmeth a thing ſo farre from all appearance of truth. Marie becauſe theſe fathers with S. Hierome, and Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius ſay, that by <hi>incenſe</hi> (which according to ſome readings the Prophet here mentioneth) are vnderſtood the praiers of ſaints, which are ſpirituall offerings: This is true indeede: but nothing to the purpoſe. For both the Prophet Malachie, and all theſe fathers ſpeake expreſlie of a cleane offering, ouer and aboue the incenſe: the text it ſelfe as M. Maſon turneth it being this: <hi>In euerie place incenſe shalbe offered vp to my name, and a pure offering.</hi> Be it therfore that theſe fathers vnderſtand by incenſe the praiers of ſaints, yet by the pure offering expreſſed by the Prophet, they with all the reſt that handle this matter, do vnderſtand the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:23816:148"/> of the holy Euchariſt, euen by M. Caluins owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as we shall ſee by and by.</p>
               <p>Againe though by incenſe the fathers vnderſtand the praiers of ſaints, yet is there no reaſon to thinke, that they should therby exclude a true, and proper externall oblation, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, more then the ſweet odor, which God ſmelled from the ſacrifice of Noe, did exclude,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21.</note> or take away the true externall oblation of beaſts and foules, which he made to God at his iſſue out of the Arke. So that M. Maſon without the leaſt shew of reaſon, affirmeth the aforementioned fathers to vnderſtand this teſtimonie of Malachie onlie of ſpirituall offerings: which is yet farther, moſt euidentlie conuinced out of S. Auguſtin,<note place="margin">Auguſt lib. <hi>18.</hi> de ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. cap. <hi>25.</hi> Chriſostom. orat. <hi>3.</hi> con. Iudaeos ante finem.</note> and S. Chriſoſtome, who vſe this teſtimonie of the Prophet Malachie againſt the Iewes, to prooue that the Meſſias is alreadie come, by the change of the Leuiticall ſacrifice into that, which is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophet. Which argument (the Prophet being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſpirituall ſacrifices) could be of no force at all. For beſides that theſe ſpirituall ſacrifices being principally internall, cannot be vnto men, who ſee not that which is in the hart, any euident ſigne of another thing wherof they ſtand in doubt, as the Iewes do of that point, that the Meſſias is alreadie come, and therfore should verie impertinentlie be brought to prooue it. Beſides this I ſay, theſe fathers who vſe this teſtimonie, if they should vnderſtand it only of ſpirituall offerings, as M. Maso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would haue them, could not inferre therupon any change of the Iewes ſacrifices into ſome better, which the Prophet plainlie fortelleth, ſaying in the perſon of God. <hi>I will take no offering at your hands, for in all places is offered to my name a pure offering:</hi> but a bare ceſſation of the Iewes externall ſacrifices, without ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting any other in their place, and continuation of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, which they wanted not: And conſequentlie the Iewes should hereby rather be confirmed in their errour, then drawne from it, ſeeing by this argument their religioni prooued to be more perfect, then that of the Chriſtians, as is before clearelie deduced.</p>
               <p>And I appeale to M. Maſons owne iudgment, whether if he where at this daie to prooue vnto a Iew, that the Meſſias whom he expecteth, is alreadie come, he would thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this teſtimonie of the Prophet Malachie, vnderſtood only of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:23816:149"/> Spirituall Sacrifices, would be a God <hi>medium</hi> for his purpoſe? I haue not ſo bad an opinion of his iudgment to thinke, that he would verelie take it ſo to be: for it is euident, that this place ſo vnderſtood could haue no shew of proofe at all againſt the Iewe: which ſeeing it is ſo, how can he thinke that S. Auguſtin, and S. Chriſoſtome, the latter eſpeciallie diſputing expreſlie againſt the Iewes, should vſe ſo impertinent an argument? can he thinke that they were leſſe iudicious, in chooſing their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies againſt their aduerſaries, then he would be? And I would haue him obſerue, that S. Chriſoſtome doth not only vrge the latitude of the place, where the ſacrifice of the new law is to be offered, which the Prophet expreſſeth in theſe words, <hi>from the riſing of the ſun to the going downe therof,</hi> and <hi>in euerie place,</hi> but alſo much inſiſteth vpon the ſanctitie of this ſacrifice aboue that of the Iewes, declared by the Prophet in theſe words <hi>a pure offering,</hi> and that not only in reſpect of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the Iewes ſacrifice might haue, from the offerers, but in reſpect of the verie offering it ſelfe, wherof he ſaith thus.</p>

               <p>If the Sacrifice of the church had either bene practiſed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corners or that it had bene a matter either indifferent or of ſmalleſt moment, ſuch as are not ſo well either inſtructed, or perſuaded of Gods continuall care and watch ouer his church as they ought to be, might peraduenture thinke it a thing poſſible that it might creepe in and continue for ſome time. But being as it is, not only the publique ſeruice of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but that at the celebration wherof, all things that are to be published, are for the more ſolemne publication de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and beſides is of that moment, as no act of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cult, worship, and religion is comparable to it, being a moſt expreſſe and direct act of idolatry (if it were not the true worship ordained by God) for the which God, iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his honour, hath from time to time ſo ſeuerely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed all nations as well Iewes as Gentils, this I ſaie being, I doe and dare boldly auouch, that it cannot be eſteemed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by any man, that hath the leaſt dram of true iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or knowledge of the foundation of Chriſtian faith and religion, that it should haue bene practiſed ſo publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely, ſo vniuerſally, and for ſo long time, (as alreadie appeareth by irreproouable teſtimonies that it hath (without controlement and contradiction.</p>
               <p>Now hauing ſufficiently prooued, as I thinke, a ſacrificing prieſthood to be in Chriſts church, it remaineth that we ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſuch obiection, as our aduerſaries make againſt the ſame. For as all other articles of Chriſtian faith haue had, haue, or may haue arguments made againſt them, euen out of the ſcripture it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, ſo likewiſe hath this.</p>
               <p>The Epiſtle of S. Paul to the Hebrewes, not truly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is depraued by the Proteſtants in preiudice of this truth, and to their owne perdition as S. Peter ſaith,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Petri.</hi> 3.16.</note> the reſt of the ſcriptures, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:23816:157"/> namelie thoſe of S. Paul are by the vnſtable: that is ſuch as will haue no other interpretation of them but their owne. Out of this epiſtle are drawne diuers arguments, againſt the holie ſacrifice of the Maſſe, whihh may all be reduced to this forme.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The Apoſtle to the Hebrewes teacheth firſt, that the prieſt of the new teſtament is one onlie. Secondlie, that the hoſt or ſacrifice of the new teſtament is but one onlie. Thirdlie that the offering, or ſacrificing of that one hoſt in likewiſe but once performed, and not often iterated or repeated: All which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth directlie againſt the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, which hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie prieſts, manie hoſts, or at leſt the ſame hoſt often offered. Further he teacheth, that the prieſt of the new law, is not only one, but ſuch a one as hath no neede to offer for himſelfe? That the hoſt or ſacrifice is ſo pretious, that it taketh awaie all ſinne; And that the offering therof is ſo effectuall, that Gods people hath no more guilt of ſinne. Which ſinguler degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the prieſt, ſacrifice, and offering of the ſame doth make, that there can be but one in each kind, as is ſaid before; ſo that this latter argument is rather a reaſon and cauſe of the former, then anie new and diſtinct argument. All this is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the expreſſe teſtimonies of the Apoſtle. In ſetting downe wherof I will obſerue the order of the chapters, and not the order of the points here touched, wherunto they may be eaſely applied.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the paſſages, which our aduerſaries ordinarilie vſe, for the impugning of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderſtanding of the Apoſtles doctrine in this epiſtle, touching the ſacrifice of the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it is firſt to be obſerued: that he ſpeaketh not any one word directlie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſlie of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, or holie Euchariſt, as eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie our aduerſaries muſt graunt; ſeeing they teach and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, that there is no ſuch ſacrifice at all. If therfore they will prooue any thing againſt it out of this epiſtle, they muſt do it by conſequence and deduction only: which kind of arguing that it may be good and lawfull, the Apoſtles principall drift, and intent muſt attentiuelie be conſidered. For it is no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full arguing to inferre that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any mans words, without which his meaning is otherwaies full and perfect: As for example Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidius did falſlie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 1.25.</note> and hereticallie vpon theſe words: <hi>And he knew her not till she brought forth her firſt borne ſonne:</hi> deduce, that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed virgin did not continue perpetuallie virgin, inferring more vpon the Euangeliſts words, then his meaning was to expreſſe, as the Proteſtants do alſo by S. Pauls doctrine, in this point of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>It is ſecondlie to be obſerued, that the cheefe intent of the Apoſtle in this epiſtle is, to prooue the dignitie, and prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of our Sauiour Chriſts prieſthood, and the neceſſitie and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his ſacrifice, and oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, againſt ſuch mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing Iewes, as held and eſteemed the prieſthood, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Moiſes law, to be euerlaſting, vnchangeable, and ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:23816:158"/> of themſelues for the remiſſion of ſins, without reſpect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of any other prieſthood, or ſacrifice to be inſtituted, from whence they might haue their valour and force.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles cheefe intent therfore in this epiſtle being this, it no way pertained to his purpoſe, to treate of the ſacrifice of the Euchariſt. For this depending of the ſacrifice vpon the croſſe, which the Iewes, for whoſe inſtruction S. Paul wrote this epiſtle, did not yet beleeue, they could not profitablie be inſtructed therin, nor S. Paul but verie prepoſterouſlie, could treat directlie therof. This being well kept in mind, it will eaſelie appeare, that the Apoſtles intent is not to ſpeake any thing in this whole epiſtle againſt the ſacrifice of the alter, and conſequentlie that whatſoeuer our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries would inferre therof to that purpoſe, they do it beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the meaning of the Apoſtle, and therfore can be of no force.</p>
               <p n="20">20. M. Fulke obiecteth, againſt this <hi>that the Hebrewes,</hi>

               <p>But M. Fulke is either deceiued, or would deceiue. For S.

Pauls owne words, euen in this place handled by M. Fulke, then can ſtand with his ignorance therin; and therfore doth he wittinglie, and wilfullie depraue the Apoſtles doctrine, and goe about to deceiue his reader. The Apoſtles words are theſe. <hi>If then conſummation was by the Leuiticall prieſthood (for vnder it the people receiued the lawe) what neceſsitie was there yet another priest to riſe, according to the order of Melchiſedech, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?</hi> And agine in the 10. chapter. <hi>It is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible, that with the bloud of oxen and goates, ſins should be taken away.</hi> Is it not manifeſt hereby, that the Apoſtle diſputeth
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:23816:159"/> againſt ſuch, as taught the ſacrifices of the law to be ſufficient, for the conſummation of our redemption, and remiſſion of our ſinnes? Certes it is ouer euident to be denied by any man, not depriued of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſence. The Apoſtle therfore in this diſpute, doth not ſo much inſtruct the Catholique beleeuing Iewes in their faith, as confute the errours, and falſities in their misbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing countrimen, as all other Catholique Doctors, and paſtors of Gods church doe, whilſt they write in confutation of the newlie riſing hereſies.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Fulke.</note>But he vrgeth farther, and demaundeth, <hi>how the Apoſtle could omitt to ſpeake of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, ſeeing as we ſay, his drift was to auouch the eternall fruite, and neceſsity of Chriſt his paſsion, wherof the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſſe dependeth?</hi> An impertinent queſtion: For as well might he aske, how the Apoſtle could omit to ſpeake of the Euchariſt, as it is a ſacrament, and of all other myſteries of our religion, which he confeſſeth (and neceſſarilie) to depend vpon the paſſion of Chriſt. And which (I pray you) of all the holie writers doth explicate all the miſteries of our faith at once, or in one place, though they haue depende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thone vpon thother? If M. Fulke had bene but half as quick ſighted in the ſearch of the truth, as he was to impugne it, he would eaſilie haue found the reaſon, why the Apoſtle made no mention of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe in this epiſtle. For the Iewes, to whom he wrote, beleeuing not the neceſſitie of Chriſts paſſion (as is noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) it could not be conuenient, that the Apoſtle should inſtruct them in that other high miſterie, which neceſſarilie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the beleefe of our Sauiours paſſion before.

For becauſe theſe fathers ſay, that the dailie ſacrifice of the church is a commemoration, or remembrance of the ſacrifice of the croſſe, they would againſt their expreſſe words and meaning inferre that it is no true ſacrifice. But by the ſame argument they maie alſo conclude, that all the ſacrifices of the law of Moiſes were not trulie, and properlie ſacrifices. For they all had the like reſpect to the ſame ſacrifice of the croſſe, that the ſacrifice of the Maſſe hath, without any other difference at all, but that thoſe, becauſe they went before, did prefigurate or forshew it as being yet to come, and this of the Maſſe is a remembrance or commemoration of the ſame, as being now paſt: which difference can no way preiudice, or impaire the perfection, and true proprietie of a ſacrifice in this latter, as is too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. If therfore the reſpect of prefiguration in the ſacrifices of Moiſes lawe, did not let or hinder them to be properlie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; the reſpect of commemoration, in the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, cannot make it to be improperlie a ſacrifice. But to come nearer the difficultie, and to declare the true meaning, and ſenſe of the Apoſtle, in the ſpeeches before related.</p>

But becauſe no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Chriſtian euer dreamed, that the ſacrifice of the Maſſe should be ſuch a conſummating, redeeming, and independent ſacrifice, as the Apoſtre here ſpeaketh of, and as the misbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

               <p>In the meane while it is to be noted, that there are two ſorts of ſacrifice (I ſpeake onlie in reſpect of their efficacie, for in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects there are diuers ſorts:) thone abſolute and indepe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Amongſt all the ſacrifices that euer were, either in the law of nature, of Moyſes, or of Ieſus Chriſt, that onlie of the croſſe is of the firſt kind; all the reſt (yea that of the Maſſe) are of the ſecond ſort. For all true Chriſtians did, and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and confeſſe, that the holie ſacrifice of the Maſſe hath the whole efficacie, and vertue, which it hath, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie, from the ſacrifice of the croſſe. And in this reſpect dependeth no leſſe therupon, then the Iewes ſacrifices did: though in reſpect of the perfection as well of the cheefe prieſt, as of the hoſt or thing offered (both being our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe) and conſequentlie of the greater vertue it hath, to applie vnto vs the merites of Chriſt his paſſion, this doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparablie exceede thothers, as S.

               </p>
               <p>This diſtinction of an abſolute, independent, redeeming, or conſummating ſacrifice, and of a reſpectiue, dependent, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying ſacrifice, our aduerſaries muſt neceſſarilie confeſſe, and acknowledge to be good and allowable, malgree all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt the ſacrifice of the Maſſe: vnles they will either whollie exclude all the ſacrifices of the old lawe, from the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="14">14. This doctrine therfore of theſe two diuers ſorts of ſacrifice being neceſſarily allowed it will eaſelie be shewed, that the ſame arguments, that our aduerſaries make out of the Epiſtle of

If therfore the argument before alleaged, prooue the ſacrifice of the Maſſe to be ſuperſtitious or none at all, it will alſo prooue the ſame of all thoſe ſacrifices, that haue bene ſince the beginning of the world. And the ſelfe ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that maketh the ſacrifices of the law of nature, and Moiſes
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:23816:162"/> (being not onlie true ſacrifices, but propitiatorie in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, euen for thoſe ſinnes that were to be taken awaie by the ſacrifice of the croſſe) to be good and lawfull (notwithſtanding that the conſummation of thoſe worshippers was to be made, by that one onlie ſacrifice of the croſſe) doth prooue the ſame of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that the ſacrifice of the croſſe, wherby the consu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is wrought, being not yet offered, there might be diuers iuſt reaſons for the inſtitution and vſe of other ſacrifices, ſuch as were in the law of nature, and of Moiſes: But that ſacrifice being now finished, all thoſe reaſons ſeeme to ceaſe, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie all ſacrifices to be abolished: It is impertinent; For either thoſe reaſons, making for the inſtitution of other ſacrifices in the former lawes, were repugnant to the vertue, and efficacie of the conſummating ſacrifice of the croſſe, or they were not. If they were, they could not iuſtifie the inſtitution and vſe of anie ſuch ſacrifices. If they were not (as manifeſtlie they were not) the ſame may be ſaid of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, which hath no more repugnance with the ſacrifice of the croſſe, then thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſacrifices had. For that accidentarie circumſtance of time, by reaſon wherof the old ſacrifices went before the all conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating ſacrifice of the croſſe, and the ſacrifice of the Maſſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth after it, maketh no ſuch difference betweene them, that by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof thone may be good and lawfull, and thother vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: becauſe the vertue and efficacie of the ſacrifice of the croſſe, did reach to all the time as well going before it, as follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing after it: It being that ſacrifice, wherin was offered the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be, which in Gods preordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſlaine before the beginning of the world, and in reſpect and regard wherof all ſacrifices were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, as being fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the valour and merit thereof.</p>
               <p n="25">25. If it be demaunded, why then are theſe ſacrifices aboliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed and taken away, and another inſtituted, if there be no difference betweene them, by reaſon of that circumſtance of time, they going before the conſummating ſacrifice, thother following after? I anſwere they are not abolished for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance, that a true and propitiatorie ſacrifice (whether it go before or follow after) hath with the onlie redeeming ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the croſſe. For by that reaſon they should not onlie haue ceaſed, but should neuer haue bene inſtituted,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:23816:163"/> as is shewed before. But they are abolished for two reaſons amongſt others. Firſt they were figures, and shadowes of that which was to come, as is confeſſed of all Chriſtians, and therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the truth wherof they were shadowes appearing, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie they should ceaſe, and vanish away.</p>
               <p>Secondlie becauſe of their groſſenes and imperfection, which fitted not the ſtate of the new teſtament, for which God of his infinite goodnes, and wiſdome had prouided better promiſes, and therfore inſtituted a ſacrifice for this time, in ſubſtance the verie ſame with that vpon the croſſe, though in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall forme different from it. Which albeit in perfection and excellencie, it doth as farre exceede the ſacrifices of the former lawes, as the bodie and bloud of Chriſt our Sauiour doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that of calues and goates, yet hath it ſome reſemblance with them in two other reſpects.</p>
               <p>Thone, that as thoſe ſacrifices had relation to the ſacrifice of the croſſe, and depended thervpon in regard of their effect; ſo doth alſo the ſacrifice of the Maſſe. For it is not an abſolute and independent ſacrifice, as that was vpon the croſſe, neither doth it redeeme vs from ſinne, nor purchaſe vnto vs grace, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies then by applying vnto vs the fruite, valour, and effect of the bloudie ſacrifice vpon the croſſe; as alſo the other ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the former lawes did in a certaine degree, but not in ſuch perfect and ample manner, nor <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> or of worke it ſelf as this doth.</p>
               <p>Thother, as they did prefigurate, or foreshew the ſacrifice of the croſſe as going before it: ſo this doth renew the memorie, of the ſame being now paſt, as S. Paul teſtifieth, ſaying. <hi>So often as you shall eate this bread,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11</note> 
                  <hi>and drinke this cupp, you shall declare the death of our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farther it is to be obſerued, that if our aduerſaries will take awaie the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that it doth derogate from the merit, dignitie, and ſufficiencie of Chriſts paſſion, of wich the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>that it alone hath conſummatet all the ſanctified:</hi> they muſt alſo for the ſame reaſon take awaie the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Euchariſt, and of baptiſme, and which is more, euen their iuſtifying faith. For all theſe do no leſſe derogate, from the perfect conſummation of our redemption, wrought by the ſacrifice of the croſſe (being neceſſarie for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:23816:163"/> applying of the merite, valour, and effect therof vnto vs) then doth the ſacrifice of the Maſſe. For if they will that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meane, wherby the merit of Chriſts paſſion is applied vnto vs, though it haue this verie applicatiue power from the paſſion of Chriſt, doth derogate from the ſufficiencie therof, then muſt they neceſſarilie ſaie, that the aforeſaid ſacraments, and alſo faith it ſelf do derogate from it, not otherwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting vs then by applying vnto vs, thoſe graces and bleſſings, which Chriſt by his paſſion merited for vs. But of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part, if they will admit ſome other meane, diſtinct from Chriſts paſſion, to applie vnto vs the merites therof without derogating from it (as all Chriſtians doe and muſt) then haue they no reaſon at all, for that reſpect, to denie the ſacrifice of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And that the carefull reader may ſee, that by this doctrine of our aduerſaries againſt the ſacrifice of the church, is erected that abomination of deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherupon followeth the taking awaie of the dailie ſacrifice, fortold by the Prophet Daniel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11.</note> he may obſerue with deteſtation, that nothing in Atheiſme it ſelfe can be more impious, then by the triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phant croſſe of Chriſt and his bitter paſſion, the firme and immouable rocke of all true religious worship, to take awaie from the new law that onlie worship of ſacrifice, which euer euen by the light of nature, hath bene with all true worshippers properlie due, to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power of Gods maieſtie.</p>
               <p>Thus is not onlie prooued a truly ſacrificing prieſthood,<note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> to be in the church of Chriſt, but alſo are ſatisfied the cheefeſt obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt it, wherupon it clearelie followeth, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Bishops that ſucceeded M. Parker, and the reſt promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him vntill this day, (of whom the queſtion is in this chapter) being no true prieſts, could be no true Bishops, as is before irreproouablie shewed, and therfore haue ſuch an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall defect in their calling, more the the others had, that though their predeceſſors had bene true Bishops, as they were not, yet theſe could be none.</p>
               <p>But now to conclude them all in one, and the ſame dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: I ſay, that though euerie one of the arguments brought here againſt the Bishops of England, ſince Cranmers fall into hereſie, should not demonſtrate them not to be lawfull Bishops
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:23816:164"/> and Paſtors, yet all of them together cannot but make a cleare demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration therof, which may be framed in this ſort. 27. Thoſe Bishops whoſe calling and conſecration is iuſtlie, and with good reaſon doubted to be eſſentiallie defectiue, and they therfore to be no Bishops, but meere vſurpers of that title, are euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie no lawfull and canonicall Bishops. But ſuch are all the proteſtant Bishops in England, ſince Cranmers reuolt, and apoſtacie from the Catholique Romane faith and religion.</p>
               <p>Therfore are they euidentlie no lawfull, and canonicall Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hops.</p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition of this argument is euidentlie prooued diuers waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt by this example. No ciuill Magiſtrate, be he iudge, lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, Embaſſadour, or other officer whatſoeuer, who is iuſtly and vpon good reaſon doubted to haue no ſuch authoritie, but is ſuſpected vpon good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be a counterfeite, vſurper, and deceiuer, is ſo euidentlie no lawfull magiſtrate, that whoſoeuer should obay him in his pretended office, should therby commit an act of rebellion againſt his ſoueraigne, who ſendeth no magiſtrates to his ſubiects, but with cleare and vndoubted war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. For to a lawfull magiſtrate is not onlie required, that the haue authoritie, but alſo that he haue a cleare and euident <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat</hi> or proofe that he hath authoritie. Therfore much more are they no lawfull Bishops, or eccleſiaſticall magiſtrate, Who are in like manner doubted to haue no ſuch authoritie, and power: I ſay much more: becauſe as the harme, and inconuenience which would follow of ſuch abuſes in the Eccleſiaſticall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, is farre greater, and leſſe remediable, then that which might ariſe by the ſame in the temporall ſtate, ſo is the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to auoide it greater, and more eaſie, by his prouidence who is ſoueraigne gouern our therof.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Secondlie, the magiſtrates in all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealths, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, are alwaies ſo euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, and clearelie knowne to be ſuch, that no reaſonable doubt may be made of their power and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And it is neceſſarie it should be ſo.

               <p>The ſecond propoſition is euident by that, which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto bene ſaid, againſt the calling of our English Bishops, and maie cleerelie be concluded in this manner.

               </p>
               <p>Secondlie their calling is iuſtlie doubted to be eſſentiallie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue; (that is, to be none at all) for the proofe of the ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie wherof nothing can be ſaid, that maie not as trulie be alleaged for their calling, who are euidentlie and confeſſedlie knowne to be no Bishops, as the Arians, Nouatians, Neſtorians, Pelagia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and the reſt of the old condemned heretiques.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdlie their calling in iuſtlie doubted to be eſſentiallie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue, which hath no inſtance or example of the like, in the whole Chriſtian church, for aboue 1500. yeares after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But ſuch is the calling of the Bishops in England. <hi>ergo.</hi> And ſo remaineth prooued the ſecond propoſition of the former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequentlie the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt neceſſarilie be true; to wit that the Bishops of England deſcended from Cranmer ſince his reuolt from the Catholique church, are euidentlie no lawfull Bishops.</p>

               <p>For where there are no true Paſtors and Bishops, there can be no true church, as all our aduerſaries confeſſe, and it is of itſelfe euident, <hi>the church</hi> (as S. Cyprian ſaith) <hi>being in the Bishop,</hi>

                  </note> and M. Carleton with all Catholiques truly confeſſe, if they be found to want both, they can haue nothing pertaining to true Bishops.</p>
               <p>That the power of iuriſdiction is neceſſarilie required, to the lawfull calling of eccleſiaſticall miniſters, and paſtors of Gods church, is without all controuerſie graunted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed of all parties, aſwell proteſtants as Catholiques: and the queſtion here is onlie, whether our English Intendents haue any ſuch lawfull iuriſdiction or no. Which queſtion that we maie diſpute more clearlie, and fitly for the capacity of euery one, it wilbe neceſſary brieflie to declare, both what iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is in generall, what parts it hath, and of what kind of iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction we are here to treate.</p>
               <p>It is firſt therfore to be vnderſtood,<note place="margin">What iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is.</note> that though this word (iuriſdiction) ſoundeth only deliuerie of the law, or denouncing of iudgment, or ſentence in matters of iuſtice, yet is it both he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and ordinarily euery where taken for the power it ſelfe that one man hath ouer others, not only in matter of lawe and iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, but in all other manner of rule, gouernment, or dominion: ſo that in this large ſignification parents may be ſaid to haue iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer their children, maiſters ouer their ſeruants, Kings and ſoueraigne Lords ouer their ſubiects and vaſſalls, and Bishops or paſtors ouer their flocke and charge.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is to be vnderſtood, that iuriſdiction in the firſt and proper ſignification is two fold, Spirituall, which is alſo called eccleſiaſticall, to which belongeth the gouernment, charge, diſpoſition, and adminiſtration of all thoſe Spirituall helpes and meanes, which our Sauiour Chriſt hath left in his church, for the farthering of man to his eternall ſaluation, as are Gods holy word, and his Sacraments, and thoſe actions and things that belong therunto, wherof S. Paul ſpeaketh when he ſaith. <hi>Let a man ſo esteeme vs as miniſters of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and diſpenſers of the myſteries of God:</hi> and temporall or ſeculer, which gouerneth and commaundeth in matters pertaining to mens temporall weale, and proſperity; as to miniſter iuſtice in cauſes ciuill and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and to commaund that which is iuſt and honeſt in all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:23816:166"/> and occurrences of the common wealths, and to forbid the contrarie. Either of theſe kinds of iuriſdiction may be yet farther diuided, into directiue, and coactiue, or coercitiue. The directiue maketh lawes, and giueth precepts guiding men to that end, for the attaining wherof the iuriſdiction is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which, if it be ſpirituall, is life euerlaſting: if temporall, is the peace and proſperitie of the common wealth, and of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie particular perſon as member of the ſame. The coercitiue compelleth men by penalties, and punishments, to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce aſwell of the ſame lawes and conſtitutions, as alſo of thoſe preſcribed by God and nature, and therfore is well tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med coercitiue.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie it is to be vnderſtood, (that leauing apart the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, or ſecular iuriſdiction, as not pertaining to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) we ſpeake here onlie of ſpirituall, or Eccleſiaſticall, which either adminiſtrateth matters immediatlie pertaining to the ſoule, and conſcience, without reſpect to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall or contentious court, as to preach and miniſter ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and therfore is called of ſome internall; or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth, heareth, and determineth, in the externall and contentious court, ſuch caſes and cauſes, as ariſe amongſt men, by the tranſgreſſions of the preſcripts, and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Eccleſiaſticall ſuperiour, and what other cauſes els are knowne to belong to the Eccleſiaſticall tribunall, and this is called alſo by ſome externall.</p>
               <p>That the ſpirituall iuriſdiction hath all theſe parts or members, not onlie in the Catholique, but alſo in the proteſtants doctrine, it is euident by their owne practices. For beſides their preaching and miniſtring ſacraments, which appertaineth to the internall iuriſdiction, they haue their externall and contentious courts, where by Eccleſiaſticall power they iudge, trie, and determine, without recourſe to the temporall court, verie manie cauſes, and eſpeciallie ſuch as ariſe by the vndue miniſtring of the ſacraments, or other holie actions: in which caſes they exerciſe both dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectiue, and coercitiue iuriſdiction. I haue ſeene a printed booke intituled thus.</p>

               <p>This therfore being cleare, the queſtion is,<note place="margin">The queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> whether our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Bishops in England haue indeede any ſuch iuriſdiction, as by their practiſe they pretend to haue, or no.

For this is meerely a Spirituall power (as the Sacraments, to the due adminiſtration and vſe wherof, this power appertaineth, are alſo Spirituall) and therfore cannot belong to the Prince, in the Proteſtants doctrine. <hi>VVe giue</hi> (ſaith M.

               </p>
               <p>And to ſtrenghthen M. Carletons authoritie with an euident reaſon. If the Prince had this Spirituall directiue iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he should alſo conſequently haue, the compulſiue, or coercitiue of inflicting cenſures, which proceedeth from directiue as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily requiſite,<note place="margin">Tortura Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti. pa. <hi>151.</hi>
                  </note> that it may take effect. But this kind of power the prince hath not, as is already shewed out of their owne doctrin: Neither therfore hath he thother. What part therfore or kind of iuriſdiction, the Bishops and Paſtours of Gods church, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from the temporall Prince, euen in the Proteſtants doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne I ſee not: Neither can M.

And therfore his doctrine of a Spirituall iuriſdiction (for of Spirituall iuriſdiction he ſpeaketh) partly receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, is euidently falſe.</p>
               <p>For though the prince haue power to make lawes, wherby the contumacious, and obſtinate contemners of eccleſiaſticall canons and cenſures, may be by corporall penalties compelled, to the due obſeruance of the iuſt, and profitable conſtitutions of their lawfull paſtors (which power both M. Maſon, and M. Carleton call externall coercitiue iuriſdiction) yet is this power ſo farre from being ſoueraignly aboue that of the church, or that the churches iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts depend therupon, that it is euidently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate therunto, and therfore doth not intermeddle with any
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:23816:167"/> ſuch delinquent, till the Spirituall iudge hath declared him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible by eccleſiaſticall meanes, and therfore leaueth him in the hands of the temporall magiſtrate, to proceed with him according to the temporall lawes, enacted for ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
               <p>And for the auoiding of all cauills, and intermedling with queſtions not pertaining to the preſent purpoſe, I would haue it noted, that I ſpeake here of caſes meerely Spirituall or eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, ſuch as M. Carleton in his words laſt cited ſaith, <hi>are ſo entirely reſerued to the church, that the Prince can neither giue, nor take from it the iudgment therof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, whatſoeuer this externall coercitiue power is, which the Prince hath in either of theſe, or other cauſes pertaining to the eccleſiaſticall, yet is it not any ſuch as he giueth, or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth to the Bishops, and Paſtors of the church (who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue nor pretend to haue any ſuch power) but to his ciuill and temporall magiſtrates. And therfore whatſoeuer this power is, it is wholly impertinent to M. Maſons purpoſe, which is to shew that Bishops haue ſome part of their iurisdiction, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the exerciſe of their epiſcopall power, from the Prince.<note place="margin">This ſaith M. Maſon pag. <hi>113.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>He maie peraduenture ſaie, that the Prince giueth them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, to exerciſe their functions freely within his territories, and therfore maie in ſome ſenſe be ſaid, to giue then iurisdiction in the ſame. But this is too too idle to be imagined. For neither is it in the Princes lawfull power to deny, or take awaie thie leaue, or liberty from the preachers, and Paſtors of Gods church, as is euident in all doctrine: Neither is this leaue neceſſarie for the lawfull exerciſe and executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of epiſcopall power, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the firſt planting of Chriſtianitie in the world, which was effected without it, yea contrarie to the decrees, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the temporall Princes, And our new reformers, who pretend to preach Gods word, and miniſter his Sacraments, do not expect the leaue of the temporall Prince, but thinke they may lawfully do it without their leaue, in caſe they will not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue it, as we ſee by dailie experience. No part therfore or parcell of Spirituall iurisdiction, haue the Bishops and Paſtors of Gods church from the Prince, euen in our aduerſaries owne doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondlie, they haue all of them taken the aforeſaid oath, and therfore haue by their proper fact approoued it as good and lawfull, wherby not onlie the Prince hath bene moued to exact the ſame of all her ſubiects, as both lawfull of it ſelfe, and of right due vnto her ſoueraigntie, but manie haue bene for the ſame reaſon moued, to take the ſame oath as lawfull.</p>
               <p>All this notwithſtanding, do they in printed bookes teach, that Princes haue no ſuch ſpirituall authoritie, power, or iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, as by the aforeſaid oath, and ſtatute is aſcribed vnto them.

For ſupreame gouernors haue power to do by themſelues all actions, vnder or within their gouernment, and which they can giue power to others to doe: As our Sauiour Chriſt being ſupreame head, and gouernor of his church, had power to do by himſelf all thoſe things, which he gaue power to others to do. So likewiſe ſoueraigne Princes haue the like power in all temporall cauſes within their dominions. Or is it becauſe this function is not worthie of their roiall dignitie?

                  </note> an externall coercitiue eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction, which ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amly (as they ſaie) belongeth to the prince; wherby if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſatisfie the afore mentioned difficulty, and to reconcile their doctrine with their oath, they are farre short of their purpoſe. For firſt this iuriſdiction is ſo farre from being anie ſupreame eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction that it is no waie eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, or Spirituall, not reaching to any Spirituall thing at all, but reſting in the meere temporall, to wit the goods of nature, or fortune: as are life, liberty, lands, or goods, wherof the prince hath power to depriue, the declared obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate contemners of the eccleſiaſticall ordinaunces, and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, but not to iudge of their cauſe or offence, as appeareth by their former doctrine. Now they know (if they know any thing in true Philoſophie) that the nature, or quality of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power is meaſured by the obiect or thing, wherabout it is conuerſant, or wherunto it reacheth; ſo that this externall coercitiue power of the prince, reaching only to things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall (for it toucheth no kind of Spirituall, or eccleſiaſticall thing, function, or action, as by M. Carletons doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related is manifeſt) cannot by any meanes be Spirituall, or eccleſiaſticall, and much leſſe can it be ſupreame in that kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: Eſpecially ſeeing it can neither reuerſe, nor controll the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall iudgment but only helpe to accomplish the ſame, by inflicting of temporall penalties where the eccleſiaſticall ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are contemned: Neither can it euoque vnto it, the cauſes directly pertaining to the Spirituall court, or tribunall, but doth only receiue the delinquents already iudged therby, to proceed with them according to the rigour of the themporall law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though this iuriſdiction were an eccleſiaſticall power (which is euidently falſe) yet would it not ſerue to excuſe them from ſacrilegious periurie, when they ſweare, that the prince <hi>is ſupreame gouernor in all things, and cauſes Spirituall and that he hath all iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſuperiority Spirituall that by any Spirituall power hath hitherto or may lawfully be vſed,</hi> as the ſtatut before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned expreſly declareth.</p>
               <p>For there is as great falſitie in this oath and ſtatute (though the coercitiue iuriſdiction were graunted to be Spirituall) as
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:23816:170"/> there would be in that, wherby any one should ſweare, that King Iames is ſoueraigne lord ouer all the whole world. For as this oath is euidently falſe, notwithſtanding that his maieſty be truly ſoueraigne lord of ſome part of the world, becauſe he is not ſoueraigne ouer the whole, ſo is alſo that wherby it is ſworne, that the prince is ſupreame gouernor of all things, and cauſes Spirituall, though it were true, that he had the coerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Spirituall, iuriſdiction. And this is true not only in it ſelfe, but euen in the doctrine of our English Proteſtants, who) as we haue ſeene) teach, that there are many things, wherin the prince hath no power, or iuriſdiction nor can haue any.</p>
               <p>Hence it is euident, firſt how vnlawfull, euen in the doctrine of the Proteſtants, themſelues, the oath of ſupremacy is, being a manifeſt breach, of the ſecond commaundement of the firſt table, as not only taking the name of God in vaine, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth in idle, and not neceſſary oathes though true, but alſo calling God to witnes, and to teſtifie a thing which they ſee and ſay to be euidently fals then which, can hardly be any greater offence committed by man.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is euident how vniuſtly the Bishops, Heath, Bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, White, and the reſt of their brethren, were depriued of their Bishopricks in Q.

               <p>Thirdlie, how vncertaine, and daungerous guides of ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les theſe new prelates are, that by their publique ſuffrage in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement firſt, and then by their owne perſonall fact in ſwearing, haue approoued an oath, which by their auerred and auowed doctrine is euidently falſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo of this ſo shameles, and wicked doubling, in a matter of ſo great moment, is worthie to be obſerued. For which purpoſe it is to be vnderſtood, that the new intendents of the new church and goſpell, ſeeing that the oath, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſupremacy did diſcharge them of all ſubiection, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the church, and Bishop of Rome their true and lawfull paſtor, and therby gaue them liberty to bring into the Realme, their new doctrine and hereſie, which without their
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:23816:170"/> ſeparation from the vnity of Gods church, and caſting of the yoke of obedience to their ſupreame paſtour, they ſaw well they could neuer effect, they were willing, and ready not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue waie vnto it, and to ſet it forward with their ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but alſo to their owne perpetuall diſgrace, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſweare therunto themſelues; I ſay to their owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: For the temporall lords being by expreſſe act of parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment priuiledged, and exempted from taking the oath, they (the pretended Bishops I meane) did baſely ſubiect themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues therunto, wheras the freedome, and priuiledges of the lords Spirituall were alwaies equall, if not greater then thoſe of the temporall lords. But they that had already broken lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with God, and his church, for the ſetting forward of their owne libertine fancies, no marueile though they made no difficultie, to morgage their honour and reputation, for the gaining of their Bishoprickes. Hauing done this, and yet finding both by the litle light of naturall reaſon, that darke he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie had left vnextinguished in them, and alſo by the vnanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable arguments, of their Catholique aduerſaries at home, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the diſauow of their moſt renowmed reformed brethren abroad, as Caluin, Centuriſts, Chemnitius, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that their fact was no waie to be iuſtified, no nor colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; they to make their double diſloialtie to God and his church, their prince and countrie, knowne to all the world, publish in their printed bookes, that they meane nothing leſſe, then to giue to the prince ſupreame power, and iuriſdiction in all things and cauſes Spirituall, which notwithſtanding they ſweare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in moſt expreſſe tearmes. For when they come to explicate, what ſupreame Spirituall; or eccleſiaſticall power the prince hath, they comprehend it all in an externall coercitiue power, by inflicting temporall penalties, which power is as much Spirituall, as oxen, horſes, houſes, lands, and mans life or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie (to which things only this power doth reach, as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy noted) may be called Spirituall, ſo that they ſweare one thing, and teach the contrary. Now hauing noted this by the waie, I will returne to my former purpoſe, and prooue, that our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant prelates haue as litle iuriſdiction from Chriſt, as they haue from the prince, and conſequently that they haue none at all.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:23816:171"/>6. The iuriſdiction, which they pretend to receiue imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly from Chriſt, they ſaie they receiue by the meanes of their epiſcopall conſecration,<note place="margin">Maſon pag. <hi>145.</hi>
                  </note> as M. Maſon expreſly teacheth, and they muſt all ſaie the ſame, hauing no other meanes wherby they maie receiue any iuriſdiction. But our Proteſtant prelates haue no true epiſcopall conſecration, as is already largely prooued. Therfore haue they not,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.</note> nor can they haue any iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from Chriſt. This argument (ſuppoſing the proofes of the nullity of their conſecration to be effectuall, as till they be effectually anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, which neuer wilbe, they are to be eſteemed) is vnanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable as well in it ſelfe, as in their owne doctrine, which teſtifieth, that they haue no other iuriſdiction from Chriſt, but that which they receiue by their epiſcopall conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But I will (for the more cleare euicting of my purpoſe againſt them) ſuppoſe, contrary to the prooued truth, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is good and canonicall, and yet will I shew, that they cannot haue any iuriſdiction from Chriſt. For the more eaſie and cleare proofe wherof, one or two grounds are to be laid before.</p>
               <p>Firſt that the power of order, which is giuen by conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo diſtinct from the power of iurisdiction, that thone maie be without thother. This is manifeſt by the vſe of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, ſuſpenſion, depoſition, and other cenſures (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as well with the Proteſtants as Catholiques) which though they take awaie the iuriſdiction from the parties, vpon whom they are inflicted, and therby make all the exerciſe of the power of order in them to be vnlawfull, yet do they leaue entire the power of order, as M Maſon often sheweth, and they muſt all confeſſe that allow the power of excommunication. Hence it is euident, that the power of iuriſdiction cannot rightly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, from the proofe of the power of order, becauſe this may be without that.</p>
               <p>Secondlie no crime doth either more iuſtlie, or euidentlie draw with it the cenſure of excommunication, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie the loſſe and depriuation of iuriſdiction, then hereſie or apoſtacie. For heretiques are exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate by our Sauiours and the Apoſtles owne mouthes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 18.17 <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10.</note> who ſay <hi>he that will not heare the church let him be as a publican and heathen:</hi> and. <hi>Flie a man that is an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:23816:171"/> after the firſt and ſecond admonition.</hi> Which is alſo ſo euident by the perpetuall practiſe, of the moſt auncient church, that it would be imprudencie to prooue it.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie it is a receiued principle, and denied of none of common ſenſe, that no man can giue to another that, which he hath not himſelfe; as for example, he that hath not a groate cannot giue a groate to another. Euident therfore it is, that he that hath not iuriſdiction himſelfe, cannot poſſiblie giue it to another.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe euident and receiued grounds, I conclude by as euident deduction, that our new Intendents in England haue no epiſcopall iuriſdiction: though (as I ſaid) it should be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the truth, that they were trulie conſecrated. Some may peraduenture thinke, that I will make ruine argument in this ſort.</p>
               <p>The pretended Bishops in England are condemned hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</p>
               <p>But all condemned heretiques are exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated and therby depriued of all Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction. Therfore our preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Bishops in England are excommunicated, and depriued of all Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction. This argument indeed is cleare, and euerie propoſition therof moſt true, yet becauſe my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will wrangle vpon the firſt propoſition, and denie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be heretiques, and here I intend not to enter anie te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious diſpute with them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> 7.</note> eſpeciallie hauing conuinced the ſame againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alreadie, by foure ſeuerall argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which they can neither ſolue nor retort, I will here vſe an argument more free from all cauill, and no leſſe effectuall againſt them in this ſort.</p>
               <p>If either the Proteſtant Prelates, or the Bishops of the Romane church; from whom they receiue their conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be heretiques, the Proteſtants can haue no epiſcopall iuriſdiction.</p>
               <p>But either the Proteſtant Prelates, or the Bishops of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane church are heretiques? Therfore can the Proteſtant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates haue no epiſcopall iuriſdiction.</p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition is cleare by the grounds before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and is euidentlie deduced in this ſort. If the Bishops of the Romane church, from whom our new intendents pretend to
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:23816:172"/> receiue their conſecration (as we haue ſeene in this whole trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe) and conſequentlie their epiſcopall iuriſdiction, which they ſay they receiue with their conſecration, were heretiques, they were excommunicate, and therby did they looſe their iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which hauing loſt, they could not giue it to their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſucceſſors, and if the Proteſtant intendents were hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, they could receiue no iuriſdiction for the ſame reaſon: So that the firſt propoſition is cleare: the ſecond is without all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batable controuerſie; The concluſion followeth naturallie, and neceſſarilie of the premiſſes: Therfore the whole argument, wher by it is concluded, that the Proteſtant intendents haue no Epiſcopall iuriſdiction, is euidentlie cleare.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And now will I wind vp, our whole diſpute with our English Proteſtant Prelates, in this short and perſpicuous argument.</p>
               <p>The whole eccleſiaſticall power of Bishops and paſtors conſiſteth of the power of order, and the power of iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. But the English Proteſtant Prelates haue neither power of ordor, nor iuriſdiction. Therfore haue they no part of eccleſiaſticall power. The firſt propoſition is cleare, and denied of no English Proteſtant, the ſecond hath bene prooued by ſundrie arguments, which neuer will haue anie true, or effectuall anſwere or ſolution, the concluſion is neceſſarie, ſuppoſing the truth of the premiſes. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do our English pretended Bishops remaine, prooued no Bishops, no nor eccleſiaſticall perſons, but meere lay men.</p>

Whence it farther followeth, that if it was euer lawfull, it is, or at leaſt ought to be lawfull now, and euer heerafter.

M.

He and they may peraduenture relie, vpon the grace of the prince for their pardons: which trulie I do not enuie them, but thinke they haue in ſome ſort deſerued fauour, not hauing committed this tranſgreſſion altogether voluntarilie, but vpon a certaine neceſſitie, not finding anie other meanes, to maintaine the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their new miniſterie. Yet I thought good to let them know, that the world taketh notice of ſuch a repugnancie in their miniſterie, euen with their owne parlement lawes, that it cannot be maintained without the tranſgreſſion of them: which manifeſtlie argueth, that either their lawes are vniuſt, or their miniſterie vnlawfull I ſay either, not becauſe both maie not be, or <hi>de facto</hi> are not, but becauſe thone is infalliblie inferred, vpon the repugnance found betwixt them.</p>

But we are quit of this traueile by our aduerſaries themſelues, who pleading, that their beſt right, and title to epiſcopall calling, is receiued from our Bishops of the Romane church, muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie confeſſe, that they haue at leaſt ſufficient calling, (for it is otherwaies altogether vnpoſſible, they should deriue it vnto them) with which acknowledgment we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for this time, eſpeciallie hauing alreadie iuſtified the

But they deliuered to their ſucceſſors the true, and lawfull calling. Therfore the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops of the Catholique Romane church haue the true, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling.</p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition (which being made good the whole argument is euident) is thus prooued. The Bishops of the Catholique Romane church receiue their calling, by not interrupted ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles: which our aduerſaries can with no more reaſon denie, then they can denie, that the ſame ſunne, which God created in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, doth now shine vnto vs, but that it is ſome other made ſince; vnles they can shew when, where, and by whom this other calling, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be now in the Romane church was brought in, which they can no more doe, then they can shew the change of the ſunne. Therfore doth it remaine cleare, that the calling of the Catholique Bishops is the ſame, which the Apoſtles deliuered to their immediate ſucceſſours, and conſequentlie the true and lawfull calling. When this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shalbe ſolued by anie other anſwere, then maie in the ſame manner be applied, to the inſtance made of the change of the ſunne, I will confeſſe it to be ſatisfied; till then, I shall eſteeme it vnanſwerable, and conſequentlie, the calling of the Catholique Bishops therby inuinciblie prooued.</p>

            <p>HAVING thus shewed (carefull Reader) that no ſect or ſort of Proteſtants, or thoſe that falſly pretend the reformation of the Catholique Romane religion in theſe our daies, haue any true Paſtors or teachers, and namelie that thoſe who now beare the names of Bishops in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are no true or lawfull Bishops, but meere vſurpers of that title, and conſequentlie that all the inferiour Paſtors, Preachers, or Miniſters ordered or ſent by them, haue no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of lawfull calling or commiſſion to preach or Miniſter Gods word, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to his people, but are ſuch as the holie ſcriptures call falſe Prophets, theeues, robbers, and wolues, if thou haſt but the leaſt ſenſe, care, or feeling of thine owne eternall ſaluation (which if thou shouldeſt looſe, it were better for thee a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d times that thou hadſt neuer bene borne) thou wilt quicklie and carefullie prouide, that thou do not liue and dy a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour of any one of thoſe ſects. For ſeeing it is a truth, both moſt euident in it ſelfe, and confeſſed by all Proteſtants of what pretended reformation ſoeuer, that where there are no true or lawfull Paſtors, there can be no true church (the church being no other thing then the sheepe vnited with the Paſtor, or the people with their Bishop) and further that where there is no true church there can be no true faith <hi>(the church being the houſe of God, the piller and ground of truth,)</hi> as witneſſeth S.

And ſo deſiring in thee no other diſpoſition to come to the true knowledge of the meane to ſaue thy ſoule, then only an effectuall deſire to ſaue it, with a competent conſideration of the points here brieflie deduced, I leaue thee to Gods moſt holy grace, who hath not only made
